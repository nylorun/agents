# Changelog

## 0.23.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- e0e39ff: **Header map, gateway and identity header credentials; `credential_rejected` on a `401`** (R2b C1, C2). For remote MCP servers and HTTP tools alike, in installation and user vaults. MIGRATION.md (protocol 10, "Header and gateway credentials" and "Tool errors the model sees") has the details.

  - `@nylorun/core`: `CreateCredentialRequest` and `RotateCredentialRequest` gain `type: "headers"` with a `headers` map, and optional `via` (where requests go, such as a gateway: `https`, or `http` to a loopback host, with no userinfo, query string or fragment) and `identity: { header }` on both kinds; a rotation may change them, and `null` removes one. `CredentialInfo` gains `headers` in its type, `headerNames`, `via` and `identity`, never a value. `ERROR_CODES` gains `credential_rejected`, and `tool.completed`'s `error` documents `server` and `vault`. The admin client's vault methods take the new bodies through these types.
  - `@nylorun/runtime`: a `headers` credential is sealed like a token and sends every header in its map; the transport's headers, `Idempotency-Key` and `Nylorun-*` are refused (`400`), and a credential header replaces a manifest header of the same name. A credential with `via` sends the server's requests there, while the manifest's URL still picks the credential and names the tools. An identity header carries the session owner's subject from the session record, and is left out for a session owned by `installation`. A `401` from an MCP server or HTTP tool is a failed tool call with code `credential_rejected` that the model sees, never retried and never `uncertain`. `via`, `identity` and the header names are stored unsealed in the credential's binding: no migration.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: the Credentials page adds Bearer or Headers credentials (name and value rows), with an optional gateway URL and identity header, and shows them without values.

- da93711: **Preview an MCP server's tools** (R2b C12). MIGRATION.md (protocol 10, "Previewing a server's tools") has the details.

  - `@nylorun/core`: `McpPreviewRequestSchema` and `McpPreviewSchema` (`McpPreviewTool`), and the error code `mcp_preview_failed`.
  - `@nylorun/runtime`: `POST /v1/tenant/mcp/preview` (the Management API) connects to a remote MCP server with the installation vault's credential for its URL (headers and `via`, no identity header), under the Host's address policy and within 15 s, and answers its server info, instructions, tools (model names, annotations, schema sizes) and renames; a `401` is `authRequired`, with the server's RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata. It runs in the keys service (`Keys.previewMcp`), which holds the plaintext, and calls no tool. Both OpenAPI documents list it.
  - `@nylorun/admin`: `admin.mcp.preview({ url, type?, name?, vaultId? })`.
  - `nylorun`: `nylorun mcp inspect <url> [--server <name>] [--vault <id>] [--sse] [--json]` prints the running Tenant's preview: a table of tools, the renames, or that the server needs a person's sign-in. Its `connect` subcommand still says it was removed, and now points to `inspect`.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: **Preview tools** on each credential of the Credentials page lists the tools behind its URL.

- 90a817d: **MCP and HTTP tool results that fit** (R2b C11). MIGRATION.md (protocol 10, "Tool results that fit") has the details.

  - `@nylorun/core`: a completed `ToolOutcome` may carry `files` (`ToolResultFile`: a media type and the host's reference) and `truncated`; a completed `ToolResult` carries the `files`. `artifactsCapabilityManifest({ save, read })` adds the built-in `read_artifact` (`READ_ARTIFACT_TOOL`, `READ_ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES`), and `codeToolsOf` leaves it alone. `SessionView` gains `definitionHash`, the definition the session was opened from. Transcript edits are split at 48 KiB, down from 256 KiB, so each `transcript.updated` event stays under 64 KiB when no entry is larger.
  - `@nylorun/harness`: a tool result's files go to the model after its output, as media parts; an outcome marked `truncated` is not checked against the tool's output schema.
  - `@nylorun/runtime`: an agent's remote MCP or HTTP tool result past 32 KiB is stored as a file artifact of the session, and the model gets `{ truncated: true, artifactId, size, preview }` (the first 4 KiB and the last 1 KiB). Image, audio and blob resource parts become artifacts too, an image also shown to a model that reads images (a note for one that does not); each part of a mixed result is shaped alone, and a `resource_link` stays a link. One step's results share a 256 KiB budget, so many parallel results never make an event near S2's 1 MiB record: past it, a result is a stub naming its artifact. When an artifact cannot be stored, the preview stays and `dropped` says why. An MCP answer past 8 MiB is `mcp.too-large`. `read_artifact { artifactId, offset?, length? }` reads 32 KiB of the session's own artifact a call, with or without a sandbox: a session gets it for each agent with an MCP server or an HTTP tool. The session view names its `definitionHash`.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: a session is shown as running an older manifest only when the definition it was opened from is not the registered one, not because the Runtime pinned its own tools (a sandbox's, `save_artifact`, `read_artifact`) beside it.

### Patch Changes

- 50e2f7e: **Protocol 10: MCP credentials come from a session's vaults only.** Nylorun no longer signs the installation in to MCP servers with OAuth and no longer asks a credential resolver. Upgrade every package together; MIGRATION.md has the details.

  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`): the MCP OAuth connect is gone.** `POST /v1/tenant/vaults/{vaultId}/oauth/start` and `GET /v1/oauth/callback` answer `404`. The vault credential type `oauth` and its refresh are gone: a credential is a `bearer` token or a `headers` map bound to a URL. Migration `0016_mcp_oauth_removed` drops the table of pending connects and deletes every `oauth` credential, writing one audit row each (actor `migration`); the Runtime logs `oauth_credential_removed` once for each, naming its vault, id and URL.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`): the credential resolver is gone.** The gateway no longer asks the operator's resolver for a person's credential when the session's vaults hold none. A process that still sets a `NYLORUN_RESOLVER_*` variable logs `resolver_removed` and ignores it. Keep a person's own keys in their user vault and attach it to their sessions (`vaultIds`). `TenantConfig.resolver`, `TenantConfig.publicUrl`, `TenantConfig.vaultFetch`, `startEphemeralRuntime({ resolver })`, the `ResolverConfig` export and `VaultService`'s `fetch` option are removed; `NYLORUN_PUBLIC_URL` still sets the protected resource metadata's `resource`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`):** `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 10 and `HOST_PROTOCOL` 4–10. `StartOAuthRequest`, `StartOAuthResponse`, the `oauth` variants of `CreateCredentialRequest` and `RotateCredentialRequest`, `oauth` in `CredentialInfo.type` and `CredentialInfo.expiresAt` are removed, and `ERROR_CODES` drops `oauth_client_required`, `oauth_state_invalid` and `oauth_failed`. `@nylorun/agents` and `@nylorun/cli` send protocol 10.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/admin`):** `admin.vaults` loses its OAuth start method.
  - **Breaking (`nylorun`):** the `connect` subcommand of `nylorun mcp` is removed (`nylorun mcp inspect` lists a server's tools instead), and the gateway's Compose service no longer passes the `NYLORUN_RESOLVER_*` variables.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: the Credentials page loses the OAuth type, the Expires column and the OAuth connect hint.

### Minor Changes

- 4bd2a0b: **Flows run no code: workflow manifest v3 (manifest-only agents, step M2).** A flow agent is data: each stage gets the previous stage's output, a switch reads it, a map runs over it and a loop asks a verifier agent. See MIGRATION.md for what replaces each function.

  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`, `@nylorun/agents`):** stage `input` functions, `switch` `on`, loop `verify` functions and `decide` are removed; a builder option that names one is refused with what replaces it. `.loop()` takes a verifier agent and a required `max`. New `.pipe(...children)` adds one stage per child; `.step()` is a deprecated alias (`NYLORUN_DEP_STEP`). `Chain`, `Switch`, `Parallel`, `Map`, `Loop`, `withInstructions`, `withoutTools`, `isSlot`, `functionKey` and the `StageArgs`, `LoopVerifyFn`, `LoopDecideArgs`, `LoopChoice` and v1 workflow types are removed. `Agent.from` for a flow takes tool nodes only.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`):** workflow manifests are `workflowSchemaVersion: 3`; no node carries `input`, a switch has no `on`, a loop's `verify` is an agent and `max` is required. A v1 or v2 manifest is refused with a message naming the change. The `fn` and `verify` Actions and effect kinds, and the `loop.decided` event, are removed. `WorkflowManifestV2` / `WorkflowNodeV2` / `isWorkflowManifestV2` are now `WorkflowManifest` / `WorkflowNode` / `isWorkflowManifest`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/harness`):** the flow engine is `flow-3` and runs only v3 manifests; v1 and v2 engines, `agentTurnValue` and the `fn` / `verify` effect kinds are removed. A switch picks the case named by the previous output or its `route` field, a map runs over an array or an `items` array, and a loop retries with its verifier's feedback until `max`. An `agent` effect carries the flow's input as `flowInput` when the stage's input differs.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`):** no `fn` or `verify` Actions are offered or delivered. An agent stage's message shows the flow's input as the original request before its own input, and each verifier verdict is recorded as `loop.verified`.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: the workflow tree draws v3 manifests (a loop shows its verifier agent and `max`); the loop timeline drops decide outcomes, and `loop.verified` shows the feedback.

- 40b7648: **HTTP tools and static approval (manifest-only agents, M3).** A tool can be one HTTP request the Runtime makes through its Tool Gate, with no Action endpoint; code tools keep working.

  - `@nylorun/core`: `ToolManifest` gains `http` (`url`, `method` `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`, `credential`, `timeoutMs` up to 300000) and `approval` (`never`/`always`, HTTP tools only); a tool is never both an agent and an HTTP request, and `fn` and `command` are refused ("Functions are not available yet"). Remote MCP servers take `approval`. `http()` builds an HTTP tool, `httpToolOf()` reads one; `SESSION_ID_HEADER`, `TURN_ID_HEADER` and `AGENT_ID_HEADER` name the headers it sends. `Agent.from` rebuilds HTTP tools without an implementation; an HTTP tool is refused as a flow stage.
  - `@nylorun/harness`: hosted HTTP tools keep their target, and `approval: "always"` (an HTTP tool's, or `DurableSessionTool.approval` for a remote MCP server's tools) pauses each call for approval. **Breaking:** `HarnessExecutors.recovers.remoteMcp` is renamed `recovers.tool`.
  - `@nylorun/agents`: exports `http` and the identity header constants.
  - `@nylorun/runtime`: the Tool Gate runs HTTP tool calls (`POST /nylorun/v1/http-calls` at the gates service, or in process): the input as JSON under the Host's address policy, the session's vault credential bound to the URL, `Nylorun-Session-Id`/`-Turn-Id`/`-Agent-Id` and the effect id as `Idempotency-Key`. A keyed call runs once (`tool_crossings`), so a re-send after a takeover joins it and one lost with the gateway is `uncertain`. Non-2xx answers, timeouts, refused addresses, missing credentials and output mismatches are tool errors the model sees. The credential resolver is asked with `target.kind: "http"` and the tool's `credential` name.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: the Agent Manifest tab lists HTTP tools with their method and URL, and marks tools and MCP servers that wait for approval.

- c135267: **Action endpoints are removed (manifest-only agents, M6).** The Runtime runs no code of yours during a session: an agent's tools are HTTP tools, remote MCP servers, agents used as tools and the Runtime's built-ins. Protocol stays 8; the `action-endpoints` feature is gone, so a client that requires it is refused. See MIGRATION.md, "Action endpoints are removed".

  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`):** the `Action`, endpoint (`PutEndpointsRequest`, `Endpoint`, `EndpointHealth`, …) and delivery schemas, `SIGNATURE_HEADER`, `OUTCOME_HEADER`, `DELIVERY_TOKEN_TYPE` and the `action.*` events (`action.pending`, `.delivered`, `.delivery_failed`, `.completed`, `.uncertain`) are removed, and `ToolDefinition.background` with them. `ActionOutcome` is renamed `EffectOutcome`. Tenant status loses `checks.endpoints`, `agents[].registered` and `agents[].endpoint`, and `counts.pendingActions`; the session view loses `actions`. A `turn.paused` interaction carries the tool call's `callId`. New `codeToolsOf` and `codeToolRefusal` name a definition's tools that would run your code. The Harness API is v2 (`HARNESS_API_VERSION = 2`): `TurnStart.options.holdMs` and `effect.resolved` are removed.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/harness`):** held runs are gone: `createHarness` loses `holdMs`, and `apiHost` its `hold` option.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/agents`):** `createActionHandler`, `executeAction`, `createActionSandbox`, `definitionDeclaresSandbox`, `isActionSandboxTool` and the `Action`, `ActionOutcome`, `ActionHandler`, `ActionHandlerOptions`, `RegisterOptions`, `ExecuteActionOptions` and `ExecutableDefinition` types are removed. `saveAgent` refuses a code tool (`tool({ run })`) or a flow tool stage before sending; its `implementationVersion` is optional (`NYLORUN_IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION`, else `dev`).
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`):** `/v1/endpoints` and `/v1/actions/*` answer `404`; delivery tokens, the deliverer, background tools, held runs (`TenantConfig.actionHoldMs`), `DurableExecution.deliver`, the Restate `NylorunAction` object, the `action_result` wake and the gates service's `/nylorun/v1/deliveries` are removed, and a migration drops the `actions` and `endpoints` tables. `PUT /v1/agents/:id` refuses a definition with a code tool or a flow tool stage (`400`); a tool the Runtime cannot run fails with `tool.unavailable`. The fixture model answers in text when the agent offers no `lookup_order` tool.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/cli`):** `nylo endpoints` is removed (a usage error that says why); `nylo status` shows uncertain effects instead of pending Actions.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/create-agent`):** the starter saves its agent with `saveAgent` and runs no server: no Action endpoint, `PORT` or `NYLORUN_ACTIONS_URL`. Its assistant has no tools, with a commented `http()` tool to start from.
  - `nylorun`: the local stack's comments speak of MCP servers and HTTP tools on this machine, not Action endpoints.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: the `action.*` event views and delivery status are removed; the chat shows `tool.completed`, and the Agent Manifest tab lists tools without a target as code tools.

- d36f0d9: **Hooks are removed; manifests are v5 (manifest-only agents, step M1).** The Runtime no longer calls the developer's code before or after a turn or a model call. See MIGRATION.md for what replaces each use.

  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`, `@nylorun/agents`):** `.beforeTurn()`, `.beforeModel()`, `.afterModel()`, `.afterTurn()`, the deprecated `.before()` / `.after()`, a capability's `before` / `after`, and the `Patch`, `Decision`, `TurnDecision`, `BeforeHook`, `AfterHook`, `HookScope` types and `runHookPoint` / `hooksFrom` helpers are removed. A capability that still passes `before` or `after` is refused with `hooks were removed: …`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`):** `manifestSchemaVersion` is 5. `capabilities[].hooks` is gone; a manifest that names it, or a v3/v4 manifest, is refused with a message naming the change. The `hook` Action and the `hook` effect kind of the Harness API are removed.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/harness`):** the turn loop runs no hooks; the turn state a checkpoint carries is `{ turnId }`, and the engine version is `hosted-4`, so checkpoints of earlier engines are refused.
  - `@nylorun/runtime`: no `hook` Actions are offered or delivered.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: the Agent Manifest tab drops the Hooks count and the turn lifecycle.

### Patch Changes

- a64aaca: **HTTP in flows (manifest-only agents, after M2 and M3).** An `http()` tool is a flow stage, and `http({ url })` is a Loop's HTTP verifier; the Runtime makes both requests through its Tool Gate, with no Action endpoint.

  - `@nylorun/core`: an HTTP tool may be a stage in `.pipe()`, a switch case, a Map item or a Loop body; its tool node carries its `http` target and binds nothing. The build refuses an HTTP stage whose input is known to be the wrong type (`flow.input-mismatch`, e.g. after an agent with no `.output()`) and `approval: "always"` on one (`flow.approval-unsupported`). `http()` without a name and an input returns an `HttpTarget`, an HTTP verifier: `.loop(body, { verify: http({ url, method?, credential?, timeoutMs? }), max })`, in the manifest `loop.verify: { http }`. `fn` and `command` verify targets are refused ("Functions are not available yet"). New `flowHttpTarget()` finds an HTTP stage or verifier by stage key; `isHttpTarget()`, `WorkflowHttpVerify` and `WorkflowLoopVerify` are exported.
  - `@nylorun/harness`: the flow engine checks an HTTP stage's input against its schema (`tool.invalid-input`), runs it as a `tool` effect and fails the stage on a failed outcome (`http.status`, `http.timeout`, `tool.invalid-output`, …). An HTTP verifier is a `tool` effect with `{ input, output, iteration }` and `context.role: "verify-http"`; a non-verdict or a failed request is `loop.verify-failed`. A Loop body that starts with an HTTP stage is retried with the Loop's input.
  - `@nylorun/agents`: `http()` builds HTTP verifiers too.
  - `@nylorun/runtime`: a flow's HTTP stages and verifiers are executed like an agent's HTTP tool: address policy, the flow session's vault credential, `Nylorun-Session-Id`/`-Turn-Id`/`-Agent-Id` (the flow agent's id) and the flow effect id as `Idempotency-Key`, run once at the gates service (`POST /nylorun/v1/http-calls` takes `tool: { sessionId?, stage }`) and `uncertain` when the answer is lost. An HTTP verifier's verdict is recorded as `loop.verified`.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: the workflow tree shows HTTP stages and HTTP verifiers with their method and URL.

- 107b07d: **Skills are files the Runtime holds and serves itself (track R2 M4).** Breaking: a skill's manifest names every file of its folder, and the skill tools no longer run in the developer's process. The protocol stays at 8 until the track ships.

  - `@nylorun/core`: `SkillManifest` gains `files`, each path of the skill's folder (`SKILL.md` required, `/`-separated, no `..`, at most 500 files) mapped to `sha256:<hex>`, so the manifest hash pins them. `skillRecords` and `SkillRecord` are gone; a declaration's `skillFiles` holds the bytes to upload (`SkillFileSource`). `load_skill` and `read_skill_resource` keep their names and input schemas but fail with `skills.runtime-only` outside a Runtime. New `DefinitionFileViewSchema`, error code `definition_files_missing`, Harness API request `definition.file`, and `definitionFilesOf`, `isSkillTool` and the definition-file limits. A top-level `functions` key is reserved and refused ("Functions are not available yet").
  - `@nylorun/runtime`: `PUT /v1/files/sha256:<hex>` stores a definition file (application key; at most 10 MiB; a body of another hash is `400`; `201` stored, `200` held already) in the Object store at `definitions/sha256/<hex>`, and `HEAD` says whether the Tenant holds one. New tables `definition_files` and `definition_file_uses` (migration `0013_definition_files`). `PUT /v1/agents/{id}` refuses a definition, nested agents and flow agents included, that names a file the Tenant lacks (`400 definition_files_missing`). Core serves `load_skill` (the `SKILL.md` body, the other files' paths, and `sandboxPath` with a sandbox) and `read_skill_resource` (text files only) from those files, with no Action. A session's sandbox gets each skill's files read-only under `/skills/<name>/` before the first call that opens it, and the sandbox's instructions name them; pod sandboxes mount an `emptyDir` at `/skills`. Unused files are not deleted yet.
  - `@nylorun/agents`: `.skills()`, `skills()` and `.plugin()` read every file of a skill's folder, binary included (not `.git/`, `node_modules/`, OS files or `.env` files), and hash it; a file over 10 MiB or more than 500 files fail the build. `saveAgent` uploads the files the Runtime lacks before the definition; `client.files` (`has`, `upload`, `ensure`) does it by hand.
  - `@nylorun/harness`: tests only.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: the agent's manifest lists each skill's files.

- Pin agents to the tested release.

## 0.21.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 3b3bdc6: **The clients use management keys (Runtime and Management APIs, step A3).** The protocol stays at 7; every client keeps working against a protocol 7 Runtime's routes.

  - `nylorun`: `nylorun start` keeps an application key (`project`) and a management key (`project-management`) for a Project, in `<Host root>/project-credentials.json` and the Project's `.nylorun/credentials.json` (still format 1, with new `managementKey` and `managementPrincipalId` fields). A credentials file holding only an application key gains a management key at the next start. Commands outside a project keep `cli` and `cli-management`. Keys are issued through `nylorun-operate` in the runtime container instead of the Admin API, and `nylorun key put <id> --management` puts a management key. Seeding the Tenant and `nylorun mcp connect` use the management key (`/v1/tenant/vaults`). Studio reaches the Runtime's public listener.
  - `@nylorun/cli`: `status`, `reset`, `configure`, `doctor` and `access signing-keys` use the Management API through `@nylorun/admin` with the Project's management key, or `NYLORUN_MANAGEMENT_KEY`.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: local Studio needs no login. A request on the published loopback address (`localhost` or `127.0.0.1` at Studio's port) acts as signed in; hosts behind a sign-in proxy and embedding keep their login, and state-changing requests still need Studio's own `Origin`. Studio learns its Tenant from `GET /v1/tenant` with its key instead of the Admin API, and its Connections page manages vaults through `@nylorun/admin/client` at `/v1/tenant/vaults`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/admin`, `@nylorun/runtime`): Studio's key is derived from the admin key alone.** `deriveStudioToken(adminKey)` takes no Tenant id (HMAC-SHA256 over `nylorun/studio/v2`). The Host registers the new key's hash at its next start, replacing the old one; an app that embeds Studio and derives its key must update.
  - `@nylorun/core`: `ProjectCredentialsFileSchema` gains optional `managementKey` and `managementPrincipalId`.

- b270017: **Agent Manifest tab.** The tab now explains an agent at a glance. A header names the agent, its kind and its manifest version, with the description below. Overview cards count its tools, subagents, skills, hooks and MCP servers and say whether the session has a sandbox. A turn lifecycle strip places each hook point (`beforeTurn`, `beforeModel`, the model call, `afterModel`, `afterTurn`) with the capabilities registered on it. Capabilities are an accordion, in the order they apply, each showing its type (plugins are marked), description, instructions (long text folds after four lines), tools, skills and MCP servers. Tools are grouped by where they run (your Action endpoint, subagents with flow subagents marked, the skill tools the engine adds, and the session's sandbox) and each shows its input and output fields from its schemas in a small code block, one TypeScript-like member per line (`orderId: string`, `note?: string`). An icon switch (layout or JSON, named in its tooltip) shows the manifest exactly as the Runtime returned it, with a Copy button that selects the text when the clipboard is refused. The tab shows the manifest the session is pinned to, read from the Runtime's `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/manifest` when the Host offers `session-reads`, and says when a newer manifest is registered; on a Runtime without session reads it shows the registered manifest and says it cannot confirm the session's version. The Studio proxy now forwards that one read.

### Patch Changes

- b28bdd7: **Local MCP servers work on a local Tenant, and a server that does not connect shows.** Additive; the protocol stays at 7.

  - `@nylorun/runtime`: remote MCP servers (`streamable-http`, `sse`) are reached under the Host's address policy, as Action endpoints are (`NYLORUN_ENDPOINT_*`, `tenant/outbound.ts`). In the local Docker stack `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]` now mean the machine that runs Docker (`host.docker.internal`), so `.mcp({ x: { type: "streamable-http", url: "http://localhost:3002/x" } })` connects where it used to fail with `fetch failed`. With `NYLORUN_ENDPOINT_PRIVATE=refuse` a server on a private address is refused; with `NYLORUN_ENDPOINT_HTTP=refuse` an `http` server is refused. Redirects are still not followed. A connection failure now names its cause (`connect ECONNREFUSED …`) instead of `fetch failed`. This applies in the gateway, a harness process and an in-process Tenant. `guardedFetch` takes `stream: true`: the answer streams, unbounded, with no timeout but the caller's signal.
  - `@nylorun/core`: new session event `mcp.discovered`, recorded once on the session's first turn with the MCP snapshot: one entry per declared server with `outcome` (`connected`, `refused`, `failed`), `message` and the number of `tools` it added (`McpDiscoveredPayloadSchema`, `McpServerOutcomeSchema`). A server that does not connect adds no tools for the session's life; this is where that shows in the event log, beside `mcpDiagnostics`.
  - `@nylorun/agents`: `.plugin()` and `plugin()` emit a process warning (`NylorunPluginWarning`, the diagnostic's code) for each part of the package they skip, so building or registering the agent says when a plugin's MCP server was dropped. The `plugin.mcp-server-skipped` message now says why: for example, plain `http` is accepted only for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`.
  - `@nylorun/studio`: the event list labels `mcp.discovered` and summarizes each server's outcome.

- 6b7b8b5: **Studio opens every session it lists.** Opening a session no longer sends `PUT /v1/sessions/:id`: Studio reads the session, so one an application created with another `ownerUserId`, a `sandbox` or `info` shows its history instead of `Runtime HTTP 409 … different creation parameters`. Only **New session** (the agent page and the sidebar) creates a session, as before for `local-developer`; any other unknown session id shows "Session not found" and is not created. A flow's child session opens from the Workflow tree through `/sessions/:id`, also when its agent is embedded in the flow and not registered: Studio shows the agent from the flow's manifest, or by its id, instead of the home page.
- 5d60e4c: Show tenant details and a documentation link when no agents are registered. The welcome screen explains that developers can use the SDK, CLI or any Runtime API client instead of requiring a generated project.

  Group Overview, Models and Credentials under Tenant settings. Manage installation vaults explicitly without legacy owner filters, show credential expiry and rotation metadata, and explain SDK session attachment and CLI OAuth connections. Existing settings and vault links redirect to their new sections.

- 8773586: **Installation vaults and a credential resolver (F9 C1).** A session's MCP credential now comes from its attached vaults, then from the operator's own credential resolver; nothing changes for existing vaults, and the protocol stays at 6.

  - Installation vaults: `POST /v1/vaults` takes `scope: "installation"` (no `ownerUserId`) from an application key acting for no one; a request acting for a subject gets `403`. The vault is owned by `installation`, now a reserved subject like `host`. Any session may attach one and select its credentials. `GET /v1/vaults` from an application key lists them after the named person's vaults, and lists only them without `ownerUserId`; a request acting for a subject never sees one (the opaque `404`). The host model vault stays hidden and unattachable. Migration 0008 adds the scope.
  - The credential resolver: `NYLORUN_RESOLVER_URL` and `NYLORUN_RESOLVER_TOKEN` on the gateway (`TenantConfig.resolver` and `startEphemeralRuntime({ resolver })` in process). When the session's vaults hold nothing for a remote MCP server's URL, the Runtime POSTs `{ owner, session, turn, target: { kind: "mcp", server, agent, url } }` with the resolver's bearer: `200 { headers, expiresAt? }` is used, `404` goes without a credential, and anything else or no answer within 5 s refuses the server with `credential_unavailable`. Owner and turn come from the session row. Answers are cached per owner and URL until `expiresAt`, at most 5 minutes (60 s without one), and concurrent misses share one request. See DEPLOYMENT.md, Credentials.
  - `nylorun`: the gateway's Compose service passes `NYLORUN_RESOLVER_URL` and `NYLORUN_RESOLVER_TOKEN` from the shell that runs `nylorun start` (unset by default).
  - Studio: the Vault page is now **Connections**, and creates installation vaults.

- bd478ee: **Subject tokens, browser keys and derived principals leave open source (F9 I3, protocol 7).** Upgrade these with the Runtime: they speak protocol 7, which this Runtime serves beside 4, 5 and 6; protocol 6 clients keep working on every route that remains. Browsers and apps present a trusted issuer's token (F9 I2), servers an operator key (F9 I1), and a person's own credentials come from the operator's credential resolver (F9 C1). See MIGRATION.md.

  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`, `@nylorun/core`): subject tokens are gone.** `POST /v1/tokens`, `POST /v1/access/revocations`, subject-token verification, revocation epochs and the `subject.revoked` stream signal are removed; the routes answer `404`, and a JWT no trusted issuer signed is the opaque `404`. A stream opened with a token now ends only at its expiry (`event: nylorun.closed`, reason `token_expired`; `StreamClosedFrame` loses `revoked`). Migration `0010_oss_auth_removals` drops the `subject_epochs`, `subject_usage` and `publishable_keys` tables. The `token` caller is a trusted issuer's token only: it loses `role`, `limits` and `epoch`, and `issuer` is always set; `GET /v1/me` no longer reports `via: token`. Core drops `SUBJECT_TOKEN_TYPE`, `SUBJECT_TOKEN_AUDIENCE`, `subjectTokenIssuer` (the Runtime's own tokens use `tenantTokenIssuer`, same value), `CreateTokenRequest`/`Response`, `RevokeSubject*`, `SubjectTokenClaims`, `TOKEN_TTL_MIN_SECONDS` and `TOKEN_TTL_DEFAULT_SECONDS`; `TOKEN_SCOPES` is `agents:read`, `sessions:own`, `sandboxes:write`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`, `@nylorun/core`): the access policy and role limits are gone.** `GET`/`PUT /v1/access/policy` answer `404`, a turn is never refused with `429 limit_exceeded` for a role (limit requests at your proxy), and an existing `access.policy` setting is ignored. Core drops `AccessPolicy*`, `AccessRole*`, `RoleLimits*`, `DEFAULT_ACCESS_POLICY`, `PutAccessPolicyRequest` and `ROLE_NAME_PATTERN`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`, `@nylorun/core`): publishable keys and the Runtime's CORS are gone.** `/v1/access/publishable-keys*` answer `404`, `Nylorun-Key` is ignored, `NYLORUN_BROWSER_ACCESS` and `browserAccess` (host.json, `createHost`, `startEphemeralRuntime`) are removed, and the Runtime sends no CORS headers. A request with `Origin` reaches the Tenant routes of the public listener with no toggle: a trusted issuer's token is served, an application key or delivery token is `403 origin_rejected`; admin routes, `/health`, `/ready` and the operator listener still refuse `Origin`. Any `OPTIONS` request is `204` with `Allow` and no CORS header: the operator's proxy answers preflights. Route declarations lose `browser` (`x-nylorun-browser` leaves the OpenAPI document) and the `publishable` credential; the token security scheme is `issuerToken`. Core drops `PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HEADER`, `PUBLISHABLE_KEY_PATTERN`, `PUBLISHABLE_KEY_ID_PATTERN`, `tenantOfPublishableKey`, `newPublishableKey`, `newPublishableKeyId`, `PublishableKey*`, `OriginEntrySchema`, `originAllowed` and `LOOPBACK_ORIGIN_WILDCARDS`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`, `@nylorun/core`, `@nylorun/agents`): vault routes are application-only, and `vaults:own` is retired.** Every `/v1/vaults` route takes an application key acting for no one (operator keys, Studio); a request acting for a subject or a trusted issuer's token gets `403 scope_required`. `vaults:own` leaves `SUBJECT_SCOPES`, `TOKEN_SCOPES` and the issuer scopes; `Nylorun-Scopes` may still name it and it grants nothing. Existing user vaults stay attachable to their own owner's sessions. `client.createVault` takes `{ scope: "installation" }` or `ownerUserId`, and `client.listVaults()` takes an optional owner.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`, `@nylorun/core`, `@nylorun/admin`, `nylorun`): derived principals are gone.** Only Studio's key is derived from the admin key. `NYLORUN_DERIVED_PRINCIPALS` is ignored and no longer written, `hostPrincipals` takes no `derived`, `startEphemeralRuntime` no `derivedPrincipals`, and `@nylorun/admin` drops `deriveTenantKey`, `PROJECT_PRINCIPAL_ID` and `admin.deriveTenantKey`. Keys an earlier Host derived stay in the database and keep working as ordinary keys; replace them with operator keys. Core renames `DERIVED_PRINCIPAL_ID_PATTERN` to `APPLICATION_KEY_ID_PATTERN`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/agents`):** `createTokenEndpoint`, `createBrowserClient` and the `@nylorun/agents/browser` entry, `client.tokens`, `TokensClient`, `PublishableKeysClient`, `client.access.getPolicy`/`putPolicy`/`revokeSubject`/`publishableKeys` and `Destination.publishableKey` are removed. `client.access.signingKeys` and `client.access.jwks()` stay, and `Destination.token` takes a trusted issuer's tokens.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/cli`):** `nylo access policy|keys|revoke|token` are removed and name what replaces them; `nylo access signing-keys list|rotate|revoke` stays.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`, `@nylorun/agents`, `@nylorun/studio`): the Studio embed message `open.babai` is now `open.session`** (`{ sessionId }`): it asks the embedding app to open that session in its own UI. Studio sends no such message itself.
  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): Studio embedding is opt-in.** No origin may frame Studio by default; list your app's origins with `nylorun start --studio-embed-origin <origin>`. A Tenant's `.env` from an earlier nylorun keeps the origins it had until `--studio-embed-origin-reset`.
  - `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 7 and `HOST_PROTOCOL` 4–7; the Host features `subject-tokens`, `browser-access` and `derived-principals` are removed. `@nylorun/studio` and `@nylorun/create-agent` speak protocol 7.

- b906050: **Studio for a team (F9 S1).** Studio can sit behind a sign-in proxy such as oauth2-proxy. A request with no Studio session that carries a JWT, in `X-Forwarded-Access-Token` or as an `Authorization` bearer that is not a Studio session, signs in when the Runtime's `GET /v1/me` verifies it and reports the `studio` scope: Studio sets its usual signed session cookie, which records the subject for its write log and ends no later than the token (at most the usual 30 days), and serves the request. Studio never trusts the header unverified and keeps nothing else. A token without the scope gets `403` naming `studio`; a token the Runtime refuses, or one that is not a JWT, gets `401`. Admitted people get Studio's Tenant-wide view; the CLI sign-in and embedding are unchanged, and a valid embed bearer session still wins. New `NYLORUN_STUDIO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`: extra `Host` values Studio serves, comma-separated (`studio.acme.dev`); its state changes accept that host's `https` and `http` origins, and the cookie is `Secure` when the proxy sends `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`. The default is unchanged: only `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` on the published port. `nylorun start` passes `NYLORUN_STUDIO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` from its environment to the Studio container.

### Minor Changes

- b352feb: **File artifacts, message parts and capability links (protocol 6).** Upgrade these with the Runtime: they speak protocol 6, which this Runtime serves beside 4 and 5. See MIGRATION.md.

  - **`@nylorun/runtime`: file artifacts.** A file is an artifact: an `af_` id, a name and numbered immutable versions, with rows in the new `artifacts` and `artifact_versions` tables (migration `0004_artifacts`) and bytes in the Object store (`BlobStore`). `POST /v1/artifacts?name=&sessionId=` uploads a file in one streamed request and `POST /v1/artifacts/{id}/versions` adds a version, within the Tenant's limits (`GET`/`PUT /v1/tenant/artifacts`: 100 MiB per file and 10 GiB in all by default); a body past either is `413 limit_exceeded`, refused mid-stream with nothing stored. `GET /v1/artifacts` lists them (by session), `GET /v1/artifacts/{id}` reads one with its versions, `GET /v1/artifacts/{id}/versions/{n|latest}/content` downloads through the Runtime with HTTP Range (`206`, `Content-Range`, `416`), and `DELETE /v1/artifacts/{id}` deletes it with its bytes. A session's artifacts go with it on a sessions reset, and appear in its history as `artifact.created`, `artifact.version.created` and `artifact.deleted` (new in the event catalog). A subject reaches only the artifacts of their own sessions.
  - **`@nylorun/runtime`: capability links.** `POST /v1/artifacts/{id}/links` mints a short-lived path, `/v1/artifact-links/<token>`, that downloads one version (with Range) with no credential and no `Nylorun-Protocol`: an ES256 JWT (`typ: nylorun-artifact+jwt`) signed with the Tenant's signing key, at most 15 minutes, and dead once the artifact is deleted. The Host logs its path without the token.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`, `@nylorun/runtime`): message `parts`.** A user message may carry `parts`: `text`, and `file` by `artifactId` (and `version`, else the latest, pinned when the message is accepted). Model-gate reads the file from the Object store: an image goes to the model as image input, a text file as text, and any other file fails the call (`invalid_request`). The record and the transcript hold only the reference. The gateway builds its `BlobStore` from `NYLORUN_OBJECT_STORE_*` (the Tenant's `fs` store without it). `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 6; `HOST_PROTOCOL` is 4–6 and protocol 6 clients require the feature `artifacts`.
  - **`@nylorun/runtime`: `save_artifact`.** A session with a sandbox gets the `nylorun.artifacts` capability, whose `save_artifact` tool saves a sandbox file (`path`) or text (`content`) as an artifact of the session, carrying the turn and tool call on its event.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`): `MediaStore` is removed.** `MediaStore` and `localMedia` leave `@nylorun/runtime/node`, and `piModel` takes `files` (a resolver from an artifact reference to its bytes) instead of `media`; images are file artifacts. The image checks (`decodeImageBase64`, `validateImageBytes`, `IMAGE_MEDIA_TYPES`, `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`) stay.
  - **`@nylorun/agents`:** `client.artifacts` (`upload`, `uploadVersion`, `list`, `get`, `download` with a range, `link`, `delete`), also on `BrowserClient`, and `session.inputParts(parts)`. A request with a body of its own type keeps it.
  - `@nylorun/admin`, `@nylorun/cli`, `nylorun`, `@nylorun/studio`: speak protocol 6.

## 0.18.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 9af30d8: **The Studio proxy is removed, and Restate runs with its own memory defaults.** Each Tenant's Studio is at `http://localhost:<port>` again (`nylorun studio --tenant <name>` opens it signed in): its own session cookie already keeps it apart from other Studios, so the proxy only added a container and a second address. The 256 MiB RocksDB cap did not lower Restate's memory, so it is gone. The first command of this release removes the proxy that 0.6 started (`nylorun-proxy` and `~/.nylorun/proxy/`); `NYLORUN_PROXY_PORT`, `NYLORUN_PROXY_DISABLED`, `studio.proxyUrl` and Studio's `NYLORUN_STUDIO_PUBLIC_ORIGINS` are gone.

## 0.17.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 0cbd5c9: **Breaking (`nylorun`): readable Docker names, several Tenants on one machine, and Studio at `http://<name>.localhost:4160`.** See MIGRATION.md.

  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): names.** Every container, the network and every volume carries the Tenant's Compose project: containers `nylorun-<name>-postgres`, `-restate`, `-s2-lite`, `-gateway`, `-runtime`, `-studio` (were `…-1`), network `nylorun-<name>` (was `nylorun-<name>_default`), volumes `nylorun-<name>-postgres`, `-restate`, `-s2-lite`, `-workspaces` (were `nylorun-<name>_postgres`, …), each labelled `dev.nylorun.tenant: <name>`. The Compose service `s2` is now `s2-lite` (`nylorun logs s2-lite`).
  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): Tenants created by 0.5 start fresh.** `start` on a Tenant whose data is in the old volumes exits 3 without starting it and names them; `nylorun reset --tenant <name>` starts it anew. `reset` and `delete` also remove the old volumes and the old network.
  - **Studio proxy.** One Caddy container per machine (`nylorun-proxy`, files in `~/.nylorun/proxy/`) gives each Tenant's Studio the address `http://<name>.localhost:<port>` (`NYLORUN_PROXY_PORT`, 4160 or a free port chosen once), on `127.0.0.1` and `[::1]` (IPv4 only, saying so, when Docker refuses `::1`). It holds no Tenant data and routes browsers only. `start` brings it up when Studio starts, prints Studio's proxy URL and signs in there (on Studio's own port when the proxy does not answer); a proxy failure never fails `start`. `status` shows both URLs, `ls` and `nylorun studio` the proxy's. `NYLORUN_PROXY_DISABLED=1` turns it off; a Tenant under `NYLORUN_HOME` or `NYLORUN_COMPOSE_PROJECT` does not use it. `doctor` has a `proxy` row.
  - **Several Tenants.** Restate's RocksDB memory is capped at 256 MiB, so a Tenant uses about 600–700 MB (was about 1.3 GB). `nylorun ls` has a `MEMORY` column (`memoryBytes` in `--json`). `start` names the other running Tenants and their memory. `nylorun stop --all` stops every running Tenant and the proxy, keeping their volumes.
  - **`@nylorun/studio`.** `NYLORUN_STUDIO_PUBLIC_ORIGINS` lists exact `http:` origins Studio also serves (Host and `Origin` checks); a login token's URL is on the origin it was minted on; `NYLORUN_STUDIO_SESSION_COOKIE` names the session cookie (default `nylorun_studio_session`; `nylorun` sets `nylorun_studio_<name>`, so Studios on one host keep their own sessions); the `421` answer lists the served origins.

## 0.16.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- f96fe32: **Studio reports anonymous page views, unless you opt out.** Studio sends page views to Google Analytics with every Tenant, agent and session id replaced by `:id` and the query dropped; nothing sent to agents is collected. `nylorun start` says so once, and passes the measurement id to the Studio container as `NYLORUN_STUDIO_ANALYTICS_ID`. Turn it off with `nylorun telemetry disable`, `NYLORUN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`; it is always off in CI, inside an embedding app, and when the browser sends Do Not Track or Global Privacy Control.
- 4b9906f: **Breaking: "Tenant" replaces "stack", and `nylorun start` works anywhere.** Each local installation holds one Tenant, and its name is the Tenant's name, so help, output, errors and docs say Tenant. See MIGRATION.md.

  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): selection.** Every command acts on the Tenant `--tenant <name>` names (replaces `--name`, which is removed), else `NYLORUN_TENANT` (replaces `NYLORUN_STACK`), else the Project link's `tenant`; `start` in a project names a new one after the project directory. Outside a project, or with `start --no-link`, commands act on the Tenant `default`. In a project without a link, commands other than `start` exit 2 and list the machine's Tenants. A name starting with `tn_` (a Tenant id) is refused.
  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): files.** Host roots are under `~/.nylorun/tenants/<name>/` (was `~/.nylorun/stacks/<name>/`) with `tenant.json` (was `stack.json`); the `.env` key is `NYLORUN_TENANT_NAME` (was `NYLORUN_STACK_NAME`); `NYLORUN_COMPOSE_PROJECT` replaces `NYLORUN_STACK_PROJECT`. Compose projects stay `nylorun-<name>`. Every command first moves 0.4 Host roots from `~/.nylorun/stacks/` to `~/.nylorun/tenants/` (renaming `stack.json` and the `.env` key), so they keep their volumes and keys. `nylorun ls` lists only directories with `tenant.json`.
  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): removed.** `nylorun legacy` and all handling of the single stack of releases before 0.4; the hidden `nylorun stack <cmd>` alias; `nylorun doctor stack|runtime`. Output says Tenant: `ls` prints `TENANT` and JSON `{ "tenants": [...] }`, `status` prints the Tenant id on its own line, and `doctor`'s row is `tenant`.
  - **Breaking: Project link format 3.** `.nylorun/link.json` is `{ "format": 3, "tenant", "tenantId", "hostUrl", "hostId" }`; `tenant` replaces `stack`. `@nylorun/agents`, `@nylorun/cli` and `@nylorun/admin` refuse an older link and name `npx nylorun start`, which rewrites it. `@nylorun/core`'s `ProjectLinkFileSchema` parses formats 0–3 with `tenant`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/admin`):** `createAdmin({ tenant })` replaces `{ stack }`, `tenantHostRoot(name)` replaces `stackHostRoot(name)`, and local resolution reads `NYLORUN_TENANT` and the link's `tenant`.
  - `@nylorun/cli`: `status` and `endpoints` drop the `stack` line and JSON key; messages say Tenant. `@nylorun/agents`: a Runtime too old for the client says "update the Runtime (npx nylorun@latest start)". `@nylorun/studio`: setup hints say Tenant. `@nylorun/create-agent`: the next steps describe `npx nylorun@beta start` as this project's Tenant and its link.

### Major Changes

- 5ca1923: **Clients for one Tenant per installation: a stack per project, nothing selects a Tenant.** Upgrade these with the Runtime; they speak protocol 5. Existing stacks are left as they are: see MIGRATION.md.

  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): one stack per project.** `nylorun start` in a project creates the project's stack (named after the project directory, or `--name`; Host root `~/.nylorun/stacks/<name>/`, Compose project `nylorun-<name>`, its own free ports and volumes), waits for its Runtime to create the stack's Tenant, writes the Project link (`.nylorun/link.json` format 2: `stack`, `hostUrl`, `hostId`, `tenantId`) and `.nylorun/credentials.json` (the key of the derived principal `project`, derived from the stack's admin key), and seeds the model provider from the project's `.env`. `nylorun ls` lists the machine's stacks and `nylorun delete <name>` removes one with its volumes and Host root. `nylorun status` shows the stack's Tenant; `nylorun studio` opens it. The old single stack under `~/.nylorun` is never touched: `start` notes it, and `nylorun legacy stop|delete` handles it. Every stack command takes `--name <stack>` (or `NYLORUN_STACK`, or the Project link's stack); `start --no-link` starts a stack without linking the directory; `nylorun reset` resets the selected stack only. The runtime container's healthcheck is now `/health`, so a Tenant that cannot open is reported by `start` from the Admin status at once instead of after a 300 s wait. `NYLORUN_HOME` still overrides the Host root. Stacks start and stop only when you say so.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/cli`): no Tenant commands.** `nylo tenant create|use|list|current|delete` are removed; `nylo status`, `nylo reset` and `nylo endpoints` replace `nylo tenant status|reset|endpoints` on the linked installation. `nylo env` prints `NYLORUN_RUNTIME_URL` and `NYLORUN_SERVER_KEY` only. `nylo` no longer writes Project links.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/agents`): no Tenant to name.** The `tenant` option (`createClient`, `Transport`, `resolveConnection`, `createActionHandler({ runtime })`, `JwksCache`) and `NYLORUN_TENANT` are gone, and no request sends `Nylorun-Tenant`; a connection is a URL and a key. A Project link of format 0 or 1 is refused with `connection_missing`, naming `npx nylorun start`. `verifyDeliveryToken`'s `tenantId` is optional: without it any Tenant issuer is accepted, since the installation's keys bind it. `TENANT_HEADER` is no longer re-exported.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/admin`): status only.** `createTenant`, `listTenants`, `getTenant` and `deleteTenant` are removed; `status().tenant` names the Host's Tenant, and `deriveTenantKey` / `deriveStudioToken` derive its keys. Local Host resolution reads the stack's Host root (`stack` option, `NYLORUN_STACK`, or the Project link's `stack`); `NYLORUN_HOME` and `home` still override it. `stackHostRoot(name)` is exported.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/studio`): Studio serves its installation's Tenant.** The Tenant picker, list and create are gone, with `/_studio/tenants`; `/` opens `/tenants/<id>`. The `/tenants/:tenant` routes and the login token's `tenant` claim stay for embedders and must name that Tenant. The proxy sends no `Nylorun-Tenant`.
  - **`@nylorun/create-agent`:** the next steps are `npx nylorun start`, then `npm run dev`.
  - `@nylorun/core`: `ProjectLinkFileSchema` accepts format 2 with `stack`, and `tenantId` is optional; `ERROR_CODES` loses `tenant_conflict` and `active_work`.

### Minor Changes

- 82d95ef: **Action endpoints: background tools, CLI and Studio.**

  - **Background tools (core, agents).** `tool({ …, background: true })` marks a tool that runs longer than an endpoint's timeout. The option is code-only and never serialized into the manifest. `createActionHandler` answers its delivery at once with `202`, runs the tool, heartbeats on the deadline the Runtime returns (each time with the newest delivery token), and posts the outcome. A heartbeat answered `409` (cancelled, lost or sent again) aborts the tool's `ctx.signal`, and nothing is posted. The new `waitUntil` option hands the background work to platforms that end a request's work with its response.
  - **CLI.** `nylo tenant endpoints [--json]` lists each agent's Action endpoint and how it is doing, and `nylo tenant endpoints ping <agent>` pings one through the Runtime.
  - **Studio.** Shows `action.delivered` ("Action delivered") and `action.delivery_failed` ("Delivery failed", with the endpoint's error and when it retries).

- 6ab4c59: **Long sessions on any model: compaction.** A session whose history outgrows the model's context window keeps going, on a 16k local model as on a 1M hosted one.

  - **Compaction.**
    - **When.** Before each model call the engine estimates the prompt: the last reported usage, plus about four characters per token for what came after. If the estimate would not leave room for the reply, the engine first compacts: it asks the model to summarize the older history, then keeps about the newest 20,000 tokens (at most 30% of the window) verbatim.
    - **What it keeps.** The cut never separates a tool call from its result. The current turn's request is always kept. A later compaction merges with the earlier summary.
    - **Overflow.** If a provider still reports a context overflow, the engine compacts once and asks again.
    - **Storage.** The summary is a `compaction` transcript entry that replaces the older entries in the session state; the event log keeps the full history. The summary call is a journaled model effect, so replays are deterministic.
    - **New event.** `context.compacted` (`trigger`, `tokensBefore`, `tokensAfter`).
  - **Custom endpoints.**
    - **Settings.** Model Settings take `settings: { contextWindow, maxTokens, reasoning, compat }` for a custom OpenAI-compatible provider (vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio). `compat` is passed to pi-ai: `thinkingFormat`, `thinkingTokenBudgetField`, `chatTemplateKwargs` and the rest.
    - **Defaults.** Without settings, a custom endpoint is assumed to have a 32k window and an 8k output limit. They used to be 128k and 16k.
    - **Where to set them.** `nylo configure` asks for the window and output limit. Studio's Model Settings shows all four fields.
  - **Storage.**
    - Model effects no longer journal the model request next to the call, so each call's prompt is stored once.
    - When a turn ends, its model effects are slimmed to their identity and status; the transcript holds the answers.
    - Session storage now grows with the window, not with the square of the session's length.
  - **Core.**
    - `TranscriptEntry` adds `compaction` (`TranscriptCompactionEntry`).
    - `ModelAdapterContext.compaction` marks a summary call.
    - `CustomModelSettings` / `CustomModelSettingsSchema` describe the custom endpoint settings.

- 9d52189: **Embedding Studio in a desktop app.** Studio can be shown inside a desktop app such as Babai Desktop, in an iframe loaded from its URL and signed in by `postMessage` with a token limited to one Tenant.

  - **`nylorun`.** The local stack lets Babai's origins frame Studio: `NYLORUN_STUDIO_FRAME_ANCESTORS` in `stack/.env` defaults to `nylorun://localhost http://nylorun.localhost` and is passed to the Studio container. `nylorun start --studio-embed-origin <origin>` (repeatable) adds an exact origin, such as a desktop app's dev server, and keeps it across starts until `--studio-embed-origin-reset`. Wildcards are refused. `nylorun status` lists the origins under `Embeds`, and `status --json` as `studio.embedOrigins`.
  - **`@nylorun/admin`.** `mintStudioLoginToken({ studioUrl, adminKey, tenant?, subject? })` mints a single-use Studio login token from an app's backend. With `tenant`, the session it leads to reaches only that Tenant.
  - **Studio.** `POST /_studio/sessions` exchanges such a token for a one-hour bearer session kept in the frame's memory; dashboard pages send `frame-ancestors` from the allowlist instead of `X-Frame-Options: DENY`; `?embed=1` hides Studio's branding, follows the app's theme and routes, and reports its own; `/tenants/:tenant/sessions/:session` opens a session by id. The cookie login of `nylorun studio` is unchanged.

    The dashboard routes `/tenants/:tenant`, `/tenants/:tenant/agents/:agent`, `/tenants/:tenant/agents/:agent/sessions/:session`, `/tenants/:tenant/sessions/:session`, `/tenants/:tenant/vault` and `/tenants/:tenant/settings` are now a public contract for embedders: removing or changing one is a breaking change.

- 9546ac7: **Protocol 4: every session event is typed, on the `nylorun.event/2` envelope.**

  - **The catalog.** `EVENT_CATALOG` in `@nylorun/core/contracts` lists every event type the Runtime writes, with its payload schema, its schema version and its source. `SessionEventSchema` is their union, discriminated on `type`; `parseSessionEvent` types a known event and returns an unknown one as the bare envelope.
  - **The envelope.** Events carry `schema`, `seq`, `epoch`, `runId`, `incarnation`, `schemaVersion`, `source`, `evidence`, `visibility`, `retention` and an optional `trace`. `createdAt` is renamed `time`. The envelope is no longer strict, so later fields never break a client.
  - **Validated writes.** `Tx.event` is typed by the catalog, and both Session Stores check each event against it before it commits (`InvalidEventError`). Workflow `action.pending` payloads may carry `path` and `key`.
  - **OpenAPI.** Each event type is a component (`MessageAssistantEvent`, …), `SessionEvent` is their union, and the session SSE and history responses refer to them.
  - **Clients.** `@nylorun/agents` reads events with `parseSessionEvent`, so a newer Runtime's event types reach your code instead of failing the stream. Studio reads `time`.

### Minor Changes

- db956bc: Studio creates Tenants. While the Host has none, Studio asks for a name and creates the first one. A Tenant with no agents shows **Connect your code**: its model provider, the `npx @nylorun/cli tenant use <id>` command, and `npm run dev`. It switches to the agent list when the first agent registers.

  Every Tenant Studio creates registers the derived principal `project` (`PROJECT_PRINCIPAL_ID` in `@nylorun/admin`). `nylo tenant use` now falls back to that key, derived from the local admin key, so a Project links a Studio-created Tenant with no stored key. When it replaces a one-time application key, it keeps that key as `.nylorun/credentials.<tenantId>.json`, and `nylo tenant use <that id>` switches back. `nylorun up` again offers Studio for creating the first Tenant.

## 0.12.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- c82aa6f: `nylorun up` prints Studio as `http://localhost:<port>`, with no login token in it, and in a terminal opens Studio in the browser already signed in (`--no-open` keeps the browser closed). The Studio sign-in lasts 30 days and survives Studio restarts: the session cookie is signed with a key derived from the admin key instead of being held in memory. `nylorun studio` prints the plain URL when it opens the browser; `nylorun studio --no-open` still prints the single-use login URL.

## 0.11.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 5278b4e: **Flow agents on workflow manifest v2.** A flow agent compiles to `workflowSchemaVersion: 2` and runs on the new `flow-2` engine; v1 workflows (`Chain`, `Switch`, `Parallel`, `Map`, `Loop`) keep running on `flow-1`, so in-flight runs finish as they began.

  - **Manifest (core).** Any node may carry `id` and `input`; there are no slots. `chain` and `parallel` are bare collections, a Map is `{ map: { each } }` over its input, and a Loop has `max?` and `decide?`. The header adds `name`, `description`, `metadata`, `inputSchema` and `outputSchema`, and `agents` embeds every agent the flow runs, so one manifest hash covers the whole flow. `Agent.from(json, { nodes, agents })` rebuilds a flow agent. Path and key helpers (`leafPath`, `stageKey`, `forEachFlowNode`, `embeddedAgent`, …) are exported from `@nylorun/core/define`.
  - **Paths (harness).** Linked agent sessions are named by the agent: its id, `[i]` per Map item, and a nested flow agent's id in front. Control stages add nothing, so wrapping a step in a Loop keeps its session. Functions are bound under stage keys (`route:on`, `@1.default.1:input`) and all receive `{ input, results, flowInput }`; `flowInput` works inside nested `flow()`. A Loop without `decide` retries with the verifier's feedback up to `max` and then fails with `loop.exhausted`. Nested flow agents run inline.
  - **Runtime.** Leaves of a v2 workflow resolve from its embedded `agents` (with the workflow's plugin roots, keyed `<agent>/<capability>`) instead of the registry. `loop.iteration` is emitted only for a Loop's own agent turns.
  - **Agents SDK.** `saveAgent(flowAgent)` PUTs one document; application mode registers the flow's executor with its manifest hash. An executor leaves `fn`, `verify` and tool actions of a v2 flow unclaimed when they belong to another manifest hash, because stage keys can shift between deploys; it reports each skipped action once through `onError`.
  - **Studio.** Draws v2 manifests: agents and tools at their session paths, control stages at their stage keys, nested flow agents inline, and lights a Map's agent from its item sessions.
  - Build diagnostics: `flow.duplicate-leaf`, `flow.duplicate-id`, `flow.agent-conflict`, `flow.v1-workflow`, `loop.invalid-verify`, `workflow.flow-agent-child`. Also fixes v1 flows passing an agent step's output to the next step still wrapped in the runtime's turn marker.

## 0.10.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- bf1c2da: **The local Runtime and Studio run as a Docker Compose stack that the CLI manages; Studio ships only as its image (breaking beta).**

  - `nylorun start` writes `<Host root>/stack/compose.yaml` and `.env` (mode 0600) and starts Postgres, Restate, s2-lite, the Runtime and Studio on loopback ports, with the Runtime and Studio images this CLI pins (`nylorun.runtime`, `nylorun.studio`; `NYLORUN_RUNTIME_IMAGE` and `NYLORUN_STUDIO_IMAGE` override them). `nylorun stop` keeps the volumes; `nylorun status [--json] [--env]` reports services and health; `nylorun reset [--yes]` deletes the volumes and every Tenant.
  - `nylorun dev` starts the stack if it is not running, creates the Project's Tenant on first run, opens Studio on that Tenant through a single-use login URL (`next=/tenants/<id>`), and runs the application with `NYLORUN_RUNTIME_URL=http://localhost:<port>`. `--no-open` prints the URL only; `--no-studio` skips Studio. `--local-ui` is removed (exit 2).
  - `nylorun logs` and `nylorun studio` are the stack commands (`nylorun stack <command>` still works). `nylorun studio` lands on the linked Project's Tenant.
  - `nylorun runtime up|down|restart|run|status|logs` and the `up`/`down` aliases are removed; they exit 2 and name `nylorun start|stop|status|logs`. `nylorun runtime status --env` is now `nylorun status --env`.
  - `nylorun doctor` checks Node 24+, Docker, Compose v2 and the stack's health; `doctor runtime` is an alias of it.
  - `@nylorun/studio` is private and ships only as `ghcr.io/nylorun/studio`: `startStudio`, the hosted (`local.nylorun.studio`) and local UI modes, pairing, the `nylorun-studio` bin and the UI bundle download are removed.
  - `npm create @nylorun/agent` no longer adds `@nylorun/studio` or a `studio` script, checks for Docker with Compose v2 instead of a global `@nylorun/runtime`, and accepts `--no-studio` only as a deprecated no-op.

- bf1c2da: **Tenants can register a Studio principal.** `CreateTenantRequest` gains optional `studioCredentialHash` behind the new protocol feature `studio-principal`; the Runtime stores it as application principal `studio`, and idempotent create compares it too. `@nylorun/admin` exports `deriveStudioToken(adminKey, tenantId)` (HMAC-SHA256 over `nylorun/studio/v1`, NUL, Tenant id) and `createTenant` sends the hash of that key, so Studio can reach any Tenant's API with a key derived from the admin key. Clients require the new feature, so upgrade the Runtime with them.

### Patch Changes

- ba1b239: **`nylorun` sets up the local stack; `@nylorun/cli` becomes the Runtime client `nylo` (breaking beta).**

  - New unscoped package **`nylorun`**: `npx nylorun up` sets up the Docker stack on the first run and starts it after that, from any directory; `npx nylorun down` stops it (volumes are kept). `up` and `down` are aliases of `start` and `stop`. It also owns `status`, `logs`, `studio`, `reset` and `doctor`, pins the Runtime and Studio images (`package.json` `nylorun.runtime` / `nylorun.studio`), depends on `@nylorun/core` only, and never creates Tenants.
  - **`@nylorun/cli`** is the Runtime client with the command **`nylo`**: `nylo tenant create [name]` (creates the Tenant; in a project, writes the Project link and seeds the model provider and sandbox from `.env`), `nylo tenant current|list|use|status|reset|delete`, `nylo configure`, `nylo env` (was `nylorun status --env`) and `nylo doctor sandbox`. It no longer provides the `nylorun` command or the stack commands.
  - **Removed:** `nylorun dev` and `nylorun dev --ephemeral`. Link once with `nylo tenant create`, then run the project's own `npm run dev`. Moved commands exit 2 and name their replacement.
  - **Starter:** the generated project depends on `@nylorun/agents` only (no Nylorun devDependency); `dev` is `tsx watch --env-file-if-exists=.env src/main.ts`. `npm create @nylorun/agent` installs the project and prints the next steps (`npx nylorun up`, `npx @nylorun/cli tenant create`, `npm run dev`) instead of starting development; `--no-open` is accepted and ignored.
  - `connectAgents` names those steps when it finds no Runtime connection. Runtime repair hints, model errors and core's sandbox message name `nylo` and `nylorun up`.

## 0.9.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- c49efed: **Runtime Clients and Admin API (supporting packages).**

  - **core:** `AdminStatusSchema`, Project-link schemas, `ERROR_CODES` (launcher codes include `platform_unsupported`, `launcher_failed`, `downgrade_refused`), `admin-status` feature, `newPrincipalId`, `compareVersions`.
  - **runtime:** `/v1/admin/status` (alias `/v1/admin/host`), loopback/`Origin`/content-type checks; the launcher ships as this package's `nylorun-runtime` bin (source under `src/launcher/`, not in `exports`) and runs the Host on the Node it runs on.
  - **studio:** `nylorun-studio` binary; connects via `resolveConnection`; waits for `dev`; never calls Admin API or writes `.nylorun/`.

  **Prerequisites:** developers install Node 24+ and `@nylorun/runtime` (`npm install --global @nylorun/runtime`) themselves; no package downloads Node or the Runtime, and there are no per-platform Runtime packages. Launcher commands: `version`, `up`, `down`, `restart`, `run`, `status`, `logs` (launcher protocol 1).

- c49efed: **Breaking (pre-1.0 minor):** Replace a single SQLite Runtime per Project or home directory with a **Runtime Host** that serves isolated **Tenants**, selected by `Nylorun-Tenant` and negotiated with `Nylorun-Protocol` (protocol `2`, feature `runtime-tenants`). Vocabulary: Host root + Tenant + Project link.

  - **core:** `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 2`, `HOST_PROTOCOL`, `TENANT_HEADER`, `PROTOCOL_HEADER`, `newTenantId` / `isTenantId`, `checkCompatibility`; health schema gains `hostId` + `protocol` (`service: "nylorun-runtime"`); Tenant/admin wire schemas; Tenant model routes under `/v1/tenant/*`.
  - **runtime:** Host process + Tenant module; Tenant model routes under `/v1/tenant/*`; `startEphemeralRuntime` for tests/embeds; executors via `PUT /v1/executors`; sandbox prefix `nylorun-<tenant-id>-`.
  - **agents:** `createClient({ url, key, tenant })`; Transport sends Tenant + protocol headers; `/health` compatibility cache; `IncompatibleRuntimeError` with upgrade remedies.
  - **cli:** Host root lifecycle (`runtime up|down|status|logs|restart|run`); Project link (`.nylorun/link.json` + `credentials.json`); `tenant` commands; `runtime status --env` exports `NYLORUN_RUNTIME_URL`, `NYLORUN_SERVER_KEY`, `NYLORUN_TENANT`; removed Project/home SQLite selectors.
  - **studio:** `startStudio({ …, tenant: { id, name } })`; proxy forwards Tenant + protocol headers; UI shows Tenant name/short id.

- fd9fd87: Add workflows: compose agents and `tool()` with `Chain`, `Switch`, `Parallel`, `Map`, and `Loop`. A workflow is a registered runnable (`kind: "workflow"`) with the same session API as an agent — `export const agents`, `saveAgent` (saves referenced agents first), `createSession`, `input` (`content` or `data`), `observe({ follow })`, `pending`, `approve`, `cancel`. Slots (`{ run, id?, input? }`) reshape data between nodes. The flow engine (`runFlowDurable`) returns effects only; `harness/src/loop/` and `runDurable` are unchanged.

  HostEffect gains flow kinds `agent`, `tool` (node), `fn`, and `verify`, each with `path`, `key`, and `iterations`. The Runtime drives agent nodes through the public session contract (linked sessions, shared sandbox via `PutSession.sandbox`), offers `fn` / `verify` again on lease expiry, and routes executor Actions by `(workflowId, key)` with claim-scoped `ctx.sandbox`. Optional `message.manifest` is a turn-only variant of the session pin (turn manifests). Studio shows the manifest tree, live node status, and session links. Examples under `examples/agents/{chain,switch,parallel,map,loop,ship-feature}/`.

## 0.8.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 1cd7dc7: Add subagents: put an agent in another agent's `tools` (`Agent({ tools: [lookupOrder, researcher] })` or `.use({ tools: [researcher] })`) and the model can delegate to it. The tool is named after the agent's id, takes `{ task: string }`, and its description is the agent's `description`, which is now required for an agent used as a tool. The engine runs the child inside the parent's turn as a durable branch: fresh context, its own tools and hooks served by the root agent's executor, its own MCP servers, the session's sandbox, and only its final output (or `outputSchema` result) returned. Empty output, failures (with partial output marked as evidence), and requests for input or approval inside a child reach the parent as failed tool results. Parallel delegation calls run concurrently, completed child work is never re-run on replay, and cancelling the session cancels every child.

  v1 is one level deep and non-interactive. Nested delegation, child tools that declare `approval`, and differing sandboxes across the tree fail the build with a named diagnostic. The manifest adds an optional `agent` body on a tool (schema version unchanged), actions and effects carry `agent: { id, path, delegationId }`, tool context gains `ctx.agent`, the durable host resolves a new `delegation` effect kind, and the Runtime emits `delegation.started` / `delegation.completed` events and filters history with `?agent=` (`session.history({ agent })`). Studio shows delegations, labels child actions with their agent, and filters events by agent.

## 0.7.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- b8d822a: Studio session chat includes a searchable model+provider selector backed by connected Runtime vault providers.
- b8d822a: Studio Model Settings lists multiple vault-stored providers, adds credentials through a sheet, and switches the active provider/model via Runtime host vault APIs.
- b8d822a: Studio Vault module lists, adds, updates, and deletes Runtime user-vault credentials through the agents SDK proxy; secrets stay in Runtime.
- b8d822a: Breaking beta: replace `beforeModelCall` / `afterModelCall` with scoped hooks. Register `before("turn" | "step", fn)` and `after("step" | "turn", fn)` on the agent, or `before: { turn, step }` / `after: { step, turn }` on a capability. `before("turn")` runs once per turn and its `Patch` applies to every model call in the turn; the new `after("turn")` returns a `TurnDecision` for the final answer. `after` hooks take one argument and receive `attempt`, and `retry` now retries instead of failing the run. The manifest moves to `manifestSchemaVersion: 4` with `capabilities[].hooks`, and `BeforeModelCallFn`, `AfterModelCallFn` and the `beforeModelCall` / `afterModelCall` action kinds are removed. Every capability registered at a hook point now runs in one `hook` executor action, an expired hook claim is offered again instead of becoming uncertain, and the durable engine version is `hosted-2`. Hook toggles now hide a capability's tools, or one tool of a multi-tool capability, instead of having no effect or failing. Studio lists each capability's hooks with how often they run and labels hook actions. See MIGRATION.md.

## 0.6.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 41e613c: Ship the local SDK registry workflow with an independent SQLite Runtime, connected tool executor, authenticated Studio proxy, and a text-and-tool starter. Replace the legacy Hono starter and AG-UI transport. Require Node 24 and include the SDK in exact release compatibility pins.

  Break the Harness execution import from `/engine` to `/run` and rename hosted execution APIs to durable execution APIs, including RunBinding, BoundRunOptions, and createRunState. Update all consumers without compatibility aliases; retain persisted checkpoint fields and version pins.

### Patch Changes

- 2898d02: Extract shared definitions and contracts into core and local orchestration into
  CLI. Harness becomes execution-only; the SDK no longer installs the engine and
  Runtime no longer depends on the SDK. Author applications through agents and
  install cli for the unchanged nylorun commands. See the package architecture and
  migration guide. Cloud installs published packages from npm independently.

## 0.5.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- Breaking: Studio reads `manifest.capabilities` (capability id, `kind`, `hasMiddleware`, tool
  schemas). `manifestCapabilities()` still accepts legacy `middleware` / `harness.manifest`
  documents. `StudioMiddlewareManifest` is now `StudioCapabilityManifest`.
- c5bbb1a: Breaking beta: make Harness `run()` a direct async state-in/state-out executor with
  serializable pauses, application `info`, cancellation signals, awaited recording, and
  agent-level output schemas. Runtime owns session scheduling with memory-default or exclusive
  local storage and imports Harness contracts. Isolate Node adapters under `runtime/node`, stream
  observations incrementally, and add opt-in bounded token previews with Studio reconciliation.
  Migrate consumers and deployment guidance together; legacy event records remain archived, not
  automatically replayed.

## 0.4.2-beta

### Patch Changes

- 4badb5b: Move model execution to session startup, provide Runtime as a mountable Hono router, and generate Hono-first projects with supervised application and Studio development. Studio now resolves root-relative Runtime endpoints correctly for custom mount paths.

## 0.4.1-beta

### Patch Changes

- d27242c: Show stopped guardrail and failed model requests as errors in Studio. Runtime now emits a terminal AG-UI error instead of marking failed requests successful, and Studio displays the reported message. The guardrails example also checks text content parts sent by Studio, including mixed media input, before invoking the model.

## 0.4.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 54ab304: Support portable Runtime protocol version 2 while retaining legacy Studio
  manifest support. Move the Studio CLI into Runtime: use `nylorun studio
--agent-url <url>` instead of `nylo studio`. Applications should install Runtime
  directly and keep Studio as a development dependency.

  Retain session lists and media across development reloads, and recognize agent
  file changes on Windows. Validate noninteractive creator startup during release
  verification with deferred provider configuration.

  Include Harness in this release so the creator does not rely on an unpublished
  compatibility pin. Ship and verify all four packages together.

Release notes are maintained with Changesets.
