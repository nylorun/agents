# Changelog

## 0.13.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- db956bc: Studio creates Tenants. While the Host has none, Studio asks for a name and creates the first one. A Tenant with no agents shows **Connect your code**: its model provider, the `npx @nylorun/cli tenant use <id>` command, and `npm run dev`. It switches to the agent list when the first agent registers.

  Every Tenant Studio creates registers the derived principal `project` (`PROJECT_PRINCIPAL_ID` in `@nylorun/admin`). `nylo tenant use` now falls back to that key, derived from the local admin key, so a Project links a Studio-created Tenant with no stored key. When it replaces a one-time application key, it keeps that key as `.nylorun/credentials.<tenantId>.json`, and `nylo tenant use <that id>` switches back. `nylorun up` again offers Studio for creating the first Tenant.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [db956bc]
  - @nylorun/admin@0.5.0-beta

## 0.12.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- c82aa6f: `nylorun up` prints Studio as `http://localhost:<port>`, with no login token in it, and in a terminal opens Studio in the browser already signed in (`--no-open` keeps the browser closed). The Studio sign-in lasts 30 days and survives Studio restarts: the session cookie is signed with a key derived from the admin key instead of being held in memory. `nylorun studio` prints the plain URL when it opens the browser; `nylorun studio --no-open` still prints the single-use login URL.

## 0.11.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 5278b4e: **Flow agents on workflow manifest v2.** A flow agent compiles to `workflowSchemaVersion: 2` and runs on the new `flow-2` engine; v1 workflows (`Chain`, `Switch`, `Parallel`, `Map`, `Loop`) keep running on `flow-1`, so in-flight runs finish as they began.

  - **Manifest (core).** Any node may carry `id` and `input`; there are no slots. `chain` and `parallel` are bare collections, a Map is `{ map: { each } }` over its input, and a Loop has `max?` and `decide?`. The header adds `name`, `description`, `metadata`, `inputSchema` and `outputSchema`, and `agents` embeds every agent the flow runs, so one manifest hash covers the whole flow. `Agent.from(json, { nodes, agents })` rebuilds a flow agent. Path and key helpers (`leafPath`, `stageKey`, `forEachFlowNode`, `embeddedAgent`, …) are exported from `@nylorun/core/define`.
  - **Paths (harness).** Linked agent sessions are named by the agent: its id, `[i]` per Map item, and a nested flow agent's id in front. Control stages add nothing, so wrapping a step in a Loop keeps its session. Functions are bound under stage keys (`route:on`, `@1.default.1:input`) and all receive `{ input, results, flowInput }`; `flowInput` works inside nested `flow()`. A Loop without `decide` retries with the verifier's feedback up to `max` and then fails with `loop.exhausted`. Nested flow agents run inline.
  - **Runtime.** Leaves of a v2 workflow resolve from its embedded `agents` (with the workflow's plugin roots, keyed `<agent>/<capability>`) instead of the registry. `loop.iteration` is emitted only for a Loop's own agent turns.
  - **Agents SDK.** `saveAgent(flowAgent)` PUTs one document; application mode registers the flow's executor with its manifest hash. An executor leaves `fn`, `verify` and tool actions of a v2 flow unclaimed when they belong to another manifest hash, because stage keys can shift between deploys; it reports each skipped action once through `onError`.
  - **Studio.** Draws v2 manifests: agents and tools at their session paths, control stages at their stage keys, nested flow agents inline, and lights a Map's agent from its item sessions.
  - Build diagnostics: `flow.duplicate-leaf`, `flow.duplicate-id`, `flow.agent-conflict`, `flow.v1-workflow`, `loop.invalid-verify`, `workflow.flow-agent-child`. Also fixes v1 flows passing an agent step's output to the next step still wrapped in the runtime's turn marker.

## 0.10.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- bf1c2da: **The local Runtime and Studio run as a Docker Compose stack that the CLI manages; Studio ships only as its image (breaking beta).**

  - `nylorun start` writes `<Host root>/stack/compose.yaml` and `.env` (mode 0600) and starts Postgres, Restate, s2-lite, the Runtime and Studio on loopback ports, with the Runtime and Studio images this CLI pins (`nylorun.runtime`, `nylorun.studio`; `NYLORUN_RUNTIME_IMAGE` and `NYLORUN_STUDIO_IMAGE` override them). `nylorun stop` keeps the volumes; `nylorun status [--json] [--env]` reports services and health; `nylorun reset [--yes]` deletes the volumes and every Tenant.
  - `nylorun dev` starts the stack if it is not running, creates the Project's Tenant on first run, opens Studio on that Tenant through a single-use login URL (`next=/tenants/<id>`), and runs the application with `NYLORUN_RUNTIME_URL=http://localhost:<port>`. `--no-open` prints the URL only; `--no-studio` skips Studio. `--local-ui` is removed (exit 2).
  - `nylorun logs` and `nylorun studio` are the stack commands (`nylorun stack <command>` still works). `nylorun studio` lands on the linked Project's Tenant.
  - `nylorun runtime up|down|restart|run|status|logs` and the `up`/`down` aliases are removed; they exit 2 and name `nylorun start|stop|status|logs`. `nylorun runtime status --env` is now `nylorun status --env`.
  - `nylorun doctor` checks Node 24+, Docker, Compose v2 and the stack's health; `doctor runtime` is an alias of it.
  - `@nylorun/studio` is private and ships only as `ghcr.io/nylorun/studio`: `startStudio`, the hosted (`local.nylorun.studio`) and local UI modes, pairing, the `nylorun-studio` bin and the UI bundle download are removed.
  - `npm create @nylorun/agent` no longer adds `@nylorun/studio` or a `studio` script, checks for Docker with Compose v2 instead of a global `@nylorun/runtime`, and accepts `--no-studio` only as a deprecated no-op.

- bf1c2da: **Tenants can register a Studio principal.** `CreateTenantRequest` gains optional `studioCredentialHash` behind the new protocol feature `studio-principal`; the Runtime stores it as application principal `studio`, and idempotent create compares it too. `@nylorun/admin` exports `deriveStudioToken(adminKey, tenantId)` (HMAC-SHA256 over `nylorun/studio/v1`, NUL, Tenant id) and `createTenant` sends the hash of that key, so Studio can reach any Tenant's API with a key derived from the admin key. Clients require the new feature, so upgrade the Runtime with them.

### Patch Changes

- ba1b239: **`nylorun` sets up the local stack; `@nylorun/cli` becomes the Runtime client `nylo` (breaking beta).**

  - New unscoped package **`nylorun`**: `npx nylorun up` sets up the Docker stack on the first run and starts it after that, from any directory; `npx nylorun down` stops it (volumes are kept). `up` and `down` are aliases of `start` and `stop`. It also owns `status`, `logs`, `studio`, `reset` and `doctor`, pins the Runtime and Studio images (`package.json` `nylorun.runtime` / `nylorun.studio`), depends on `@nylorun/core` only, and never creates Tenants.
  - **`@nylorun/cli`** is the Runtime client with the command **`nylo`**: `nylo tenant create [name]` (creates the Tenant; in a project, writes the Project link and seeds the model provider and sandbox from `.env`), `nylo tenant current|list|use|status|reset|delete`, `nylo configure`, `nylo env` (was `nylorun status --env`) and `nylo doctor sandbox`. It no longer provides the `nylorun` command or the stack commands.
  - **Removed:** `nylorun dev` and `nylorun dev --ephemeral`. Link once with `nylo tenant create`, then run the project's own `npm run dev`. Moved commands exit 2 and name their replacement.
  - **Starter:** the generated project depends on `@nylorun/agents` only (no Nylorun devDependency); `dev` is `tsx watch --env-file-if-exists=.env src/main.ts`. `npm create @nylorun/agent` installs the project and prints the next steps (`npx nylorun up`, `npx @nylorun/cli tenant create`, `npm run dev`) instead of starting development; `--no-open` is accepted and ignored.
  - `connectAgents` names those steps when it finds no Runtime connection. Runtime repair hints, model errors and core's sandbox message name `nylo` and `nylorun up`.

## 0.9.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- c49efed: **Runtime Clients and Admin API (supporting packages).**

  - **core:** `AdminStatusSchema`, Project-link schemas, `ERROR_CODES` (launcher codes include `platform_unsupported`, `launcher_failed`, `downgrade_refused`), `admin-status` feature, `newPrincipalId`, `compareVersions`.
  - **runtime:** `/v1/admin/status` (alias `/v1/admin/host`), loopback/`Origin`/content-type checks; the launcher ships as this package's `nylorun-runtime` bin (source under `src/launcher/`, not in `exports`) and runs the Host on the Node it runs on.
  - **studio:** `nylorun-studio` binary; connects via `resolveConnection`; waits for `dev`; never calls Admin API or writes `.nylorun/`.

  **Prerequisites:** developers install Node 24+ and `@nylorun/runtime` (`npm install --global @nylorun/runtime`) themselves; no package downloads Node or the Runtime, and there are no per-platform Runtime packages. Launcher commands: `version`, `up`, `down`, `restart`, `run`, `status`, `logs` (launcher protocol 1).

- c49efed: **Breaking (pre-1.0 minor):** Replace a single SQLite Runtime per Project or home directory with a **Runtime Host** that serves isolated **Tenants**, selected by `Nylorun-Tenant` and negotiated with `Nylorun-Protocol` (protocol `2`, feature `runtime-tenants`). Vocabulary: Host root + Tenant + Project link.

  - **core:** `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 2`, `HOST_PROTOCOL`, `TENANT_HEADER`, `PROTOCOL_HEADER`, `newTenantId` / `isTenantId`, `checkCompatibility`; health schema gains `hostId` + `protocol` (`service: "nylorun-runtime"`); Tenant/admin wire schemas; Tenant model routes under `/v1/tenant/*`.
  - **runtime:** Host process + Tenant module; Tenant model routes under `/v1/tenant/*`; `startEphemeralRuntime` for tests/embeds; executors via `PUT /v1/executors`; sandbox prefix `nylorun-<tenant-id>-`.
  - **agents:** `createClient({ url, key, tenant })`; Transport sends Tenant + protocol headers; `/health` compatibility cache; `IncompatibleRuntimeError` with upgrade remedies.
  - **cli:** Host root lifecycle (`runtime up|down|status|logs|restart|run`); Project link (`.nylorun/link.json` + `credentials.json`); `tenant` commands; `runtime status --env` exports `NYLORUN_RUNTIME_URL`, `NYLORUN_SERVER_KEY`, `NYLORUN_TENANT`; removed Project/home SQLite selectors.
  - **studio:** `startStudio({ …, tenant: { id, name } })`; proxy forwards Tenant + protocol headers; UI shows Tenant name/short id.

- fd9fd87: Add workflows: compose agents and `tool()` with `Chain`, `Switch`, `Parallel`, `Map`, and `Loop`. A workflow is a registered runnable (`kind: "workflow"`) with the same session API as an agent — `export const agents`, `saveAgent` (saves referenced agents first), `createSession`, `input` (`content` or `data`), `observe({ follow })`, `pending`, `approve`, `cancel`. Slots (`{ run, id?, input? }`) reshape data between nodes. The flow engine (`runFlowDurable`) returns effects only; `harness/src/loop/` and `runDurable` are unchanged.

  HostEffect gains flow kinds `agent`, `tool` (node), `fn`, and `verify`, each with `path`, `key`, and `iterations`. The Runtime drives agent nodes through the public session contract (linked sessions, shared sandbox via `PutSession.sandbox`), offers `fn` / `verify` again on lease expiry, and routes executor Actions by `(workflowId, key)` with claim-scoped `ctx.sandbox`. Optional `message.manifest` is a turn-only variant of the session pin (turn manifests). Studio shows the manifest tree, live node status, and session links. Examples under `examples/agents/{chain,switch,parallel,map,loop,ship-feature}/`.

## 0.8.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 1cd7dc7: Add subagents: put an agent in another agent's `tools` (`Agent({ tools: [lookupOrder, researcher] })` or `.use({ tools: [researcher] })`) and the model can delegate to it. The tool is named after the agent's id, takes `{ task: string }`, and its description is the agent's `description`, which is now required for an agent used as a tool. The engine runs the child inside the parent's turn as a durable branch: fresh context, its own tools and hooks served by the root agent's executor, its own MCP servers, the session's sandbox, and only its final output (or `outputSchema` result) returned. Empty output, failures (with partial output marked as evidence), and requests for input or approval inside a child reach the parent as failed tool results. Parallel delegation calls run concurrently, completed child work is never re-run on replay, and cancelling the session cancels every child.

  v1 is one level deep and non-interactive. Nested delegation, child tools that declare `approval`, and differing sandboxes across the tree fail the build with a named diagnostic. The manifest adds an optional `agent` body on a tool (schema version unchanged), actions and effects carry `agent: { id, path, delegationId }`, tool context gains `ctx.agent`, the durable host resolves a new `delegation` effect kind, and the Runtime emits `delegation.started` / `delegation.completed` events and filters history with `?agent=` (`session.history({ agent })`). Studio shows delegations, labels child actions with their agent, and filters events by agent.

## 0.7.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- b8d822a: Studio session chat includes a searchable model+provider selector backed by connected Runtime vault providers.
- b8d822a: Studio Model Settings lists multiple vault-stored providers, adds credentials through a sheet, and switches the active provider/model via Runtime host vault APIs.
- b8d822a: Studio Vault module lists, adds, updates, and deletes Runtime user-vault credentials through the agents SDK proxy; secrets stay in Runtime.
- b8d822a: Breaking beta: replace `beforeModelCall` / `afterModelCall` with scoped hooks. Register `before("turn" | "step", fn)` and `after("step" | "turn", fn)` on the agent, or `before: { turn, step }` / `after: { step, turn }` on a capability. `before("turn")` runs once per turn and its `Patch` applies to every model call in the turn; the new `after("turn")` returns a `TurnDecision` for the final answer. `after` hooks take one argument and receive `attempt`, and `retry` now retries instead of failing the run. The manifest moves to `manifestSchemaVersion: 4` with `capabilities[].hooks`, and `BeforeModelCallFn`, `AfterModelCallFn` and the `beforeModelCall` / `afterModelCall` action kinds are removed. Every capability registered at a hook point now runs in one `hook` executor action, an expired hook claim is offered again instead of becoming uncertain, and the durable engine version is `hosted-2`. Hook toggles now hide a capability's tools, or one tool of a multi-tool capability, instead of having no effect or failing. Studio lists each capability's hooks with how often they run and labels hook actions. See MIGRATION.md.

## 0.6.1-beta

### Patch Changes

- 3a88f51: Ship Agent-Plugins (`plugin()` / `loadPlugin`), Skills (`load_skill` / skill resources), Runtime MCP pool + vault credentials, and manifest v3 capability fields. Validate completed tool `output` against the tool output schema so ordinary tools with `outputSchema` no longer false-fail as `tool.invalid-output`.

  - @nylorun/agents@0.3.0-beta

## 0.6.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 41e613c: Ship the local SDK registry workflow with an independent SQLite Runtime, connected tool executor, authenticated Studio proxy, and a text-and-tool starter. Replace the legacy Hono starter and AG-UI transport. Require Node 24 and include the SDK in exact release compatibility pins.

  Break the Harness execution import from `/engine` to `/run` and rename hosted execution APIs to durable execution APIs, including RunBinding, BoundRunOptions, and createRunState. Update all consumers without compatibility aliases; retain persisted checkpoint fields and version pins.

### Patch Changes

- 2898d02: Extract shared definitions and contracts into core and local orchestration into
  CLI. Harness becomes execution-only; the SDK no longer installs the engine and
  Runtime no longer depends on the SDK. Author applications through agents and
  install cli for the unchanged nylorun commands. See the package architecture and
  migration guide. Cloud installs published packages from npm independently.
- Pin agents to the tested release.

- Updated dependencies [2898d02]
- Updated dependencies
  - @nylorun/agents@0.2.0-beta

## 0.5.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- Breaking: Studio reads `manifest.capabilities` (capability id, `kind`, `hasMiddleware`, tool
  schemas). `manifestCapabilities()` still accepts legacy `middleware` / `harness.manifest`
  documents. `StudioMiddlewareManifest` is now `StudioCapabilityManifest`.
- c5bbb1a: Breaking beta: make Harness `run()` a direct async state-in/state-out executor with
  serializable pauses, application `info`, cancellation signals, awaited recording, and
  agent-level output schemas. Runtime owns session scheduling with memory-default or exclusive
  local storage and imports Harness contracts. Isolate Node adapters under `runtime/node`, stream
  observations incrementally, and add opt-in bounded token previews with Studio reconciliation.
  Migrate consumers and deployment guidance together; legacy event records remain archived, not
  automatically replayed.

## 0.4.2-beta

### Patch Changes

- 4badb5b: Move model execution to session startup, provide Runtime as a mountable Hono router, and generate Hono-first projects with supervised application and Studio development. Studio now resolves root-relative Runtime endpoints correctly for custom mount paths.

## 0.4.1-beta

### Patch Changes

- d27242c: Show stopped guardrail and failed model requests as errors in Studio. Runtime now emits a terminal AG-UI error instead of marking failed requests successful, and Studio displays the reported message. The guardrails example also checks text content parts sent by Studio, including mixed media input, before invoking the model.

## 0.4.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 54ab304: Support portable Runtime protocol version 2 while retaining legacy Studio
  manifest support. Move the Studio CLI into Runtime: use `nylorun studio
--agent-url <url>` instead of `nylo studio`. Applications should install Runtime
  directly and keep Studio as a development dependency.

  Retain session lists and media across development reloads, and recognize agent
  file changes on Windows. Validate noninteractive creator startup during release
  verification with deferred provider configuration.

  Include Harness in this release so the creator does not rely on an unpublished
  compatibility pin. Ship and verify all four packages together.

Release notes are maintained with Changesets.
