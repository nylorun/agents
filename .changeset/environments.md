**Environments replace sandboxes and vaults (protocol 11). This is a fresh start: upgrading deletes your sandboxes, their disks and every vault except the model's, and closes every open session (its history stays readable).** List what you have before upgrading; see "Environments replace sandboxes and vaults" in MIGRATION.md.

An Environment is where sessions run: one sandbox (kind `virtual`, `pod` or `none`) with a recipe that can change, and one vault of secrets for its shell, MCP servers and HTTP tools. The app decides who uses which Environment; the Runtime keeps it by id and holds its lifecycle.

- `@nylorun/core`: protocol 11 (the Host accepts 11 only; older clients get `426`), required feature `environments`. `PutEnvironmentRequestSchema`, `EnvironmentViewSchema` (`recipe`, `version`, `appliedVersion`, `ownerUserId`, `lastUsedAt`), `PutEnvironmentSecretRequestSchema`, `EnvironmentSecretViewSchema`, `ENVIRONMENT_EVENT_TYPES`, `TenantEnvironmentsConfigSchema`, `environmentGranted`. `PutSessionRequest.environment` replaces `sandbox`, `vaultIds` and `credentialSelections`; `SessionView.environment` replaces the session's sandbox and vault fields. Error codes `environment_busy`, `environment_unavailable`, `environment_lost`, `environment_not_granted`, `environment_owner_mismatch` and `session_closed` (the `sandbox_*` codes and `sandbox_expired` are gone); session events `environment.state`, `environment.exec` and `environment.attached`; scope `environments:write`. Credential coverage takes `environmentId` and answers `covered` or `missing`; the MCP preview takes `environmentId`. The vault Management schemas are removed.
- `@nylorun/runtime`: `/v1/environments/{id}` replaces `/v1/sandboxes/{id}`: `PUT` creates, finds or changes one (`kind` and `storage` fixed; a recipe change bumps `version`; a pod gets a new image or resources at its next start from stopped, a new allowlist within seconds), with list by label, events (`nylorun.environment-event/1`), stop, reset and delete. Each Environment owns one vault: `PUT|GET|DELETE /v1/environments/{id}/secrets/{name}` on the Runtime API, write-only, with a second credential for a host or URL refused at the write (`409 credential_conflict`). An optional owner guard (`ownerUserId`) is checked when a session opens and at every turn start. `lifecycle.deleteAfter` deletes an Environment unused that long; TTL and `onExpiry` are gone. Kind `none` holds secrets for MCP-only agents. `/v1/tenant/vaults`, user and installation vaults, the Tenant's default sandbox, inline sandboxes and `{ session }` sharing are removed. The Tenant setting is `environments.config` (`limits.environments`). Identity files grant `environments:` (an old `sandboxes:` key, or `sandboxes:write`, stops the Runtime with a message naming the new key). Migration `0020_environments`.
- `@nylorun/harness`: the Harness API claims `environment.state` and `environment.exec`, and its workspace fields name `environmentId`.
- `@nylorun/agents`: `client.environments` (`put`, `get`, `list`, `page`, `stop`, `reset`, `delete`, `events`, `secrets.put|list|get|delete`, `forSession`) replaces `client.sandboxes`; `createSession({ environment })`; `sessions.page({ environmentId })` filters by Environment. The AG-UI handler's session options take `environment`.
- `@nylorun/admin`: `admin.coverage({ agentId, environmentId })` replaces `admin.vaults`; `admin.mcp.preview({ url, environmentId })`.
- `@nylorun/studio`: Environments replace Sandboxes, with a create form, stop, reset, delete and their secrets; the Credentials forms write an Environment's secrets; New session picks an Environment and shows its coverage.
- `nylorun`: `nylorun sandbox ls|rm` list and delete Environments; `nylorun mcp inspect --environment <id>` replaces `--vault`; `nylo reset --environments` replaces `--sandboxes`; `nylo doctor sandbox` reports the Environment limits.
