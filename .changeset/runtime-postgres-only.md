**Tenants are Postgres schemas only; SQLite and the `nylorun-runtime` launcher are removed (breaking beta).**

- The Runtime runs on Postgres (the Session Store, one schema per Tenant), Restate (Durable Session Execution: one advance per session, fenced by an ownership epoch, and a per-Tenant sweep) and S2 (Durable Streams: every event is written to a Postgres outbox and relayed to the session's stream, which history and SSE read). `--role api|worker|all` selects the process role; `/ready` covers Postgres, Restate and S2.
- SQLite Tenants are not migrated. On first start the Runtime moves every `tenants/<id>/` directory that holds a `tenant.sqlite` to `trash/<id>-sqlite-<time>/` and logs `sqlite_tenant_moved_to_trash`; recreate those Tenants.
- `@nylorun/runtime` has no bin: the `nylorun-runtime` launcher and `host-state.json` are gone. The Runtime runs as the `ghcr.io/nylorun/runtime` image (`nylorun start`); its Host entry requires `NYLORUN_DATABASE_URL`.
- `openTenantRuntime(config, hooks)` requires the Tenant's opened `store` and `envelope`; `OpenTenantRuntime` receives them from the Tenant store. `HostStateFile` is no longer exported.
- `@nylorun/core`: `LAUNCHER_PROTOCOL` and the launcher error codes are removed; `QuarantineSchema` drops `locked`, `lockPath` and `lockPid`; `TenantStatusSchema.checks.sqlite` is now `checks.store`. `TenantStatusSchema` gains optional `execution` (stuck invocations) and `streams` (basin, outbox depth, relay lag); `HostAggregateSchema` gains optional `outboxDepth` and `relayLagMs`.
