**`nylo` ships in `nylorun`; `@nylorun/cli` is deprecated.** One package runs a project's local Tenant (`nylorun`) and is the Runtime client of the linked installation (`nylo`). MIGRATION.md ("`nylo` ships in `nylorun`") has the details.

- `nylorun`: a second bin, `nylo` (`npx -p nylorun nylo <command>`), with the same commands, flags, output and exit codes as `@nylorun/cli`'s. The `nylorun` command never loads it. nylorun now depends on `@nylorun/admin`, which `nylo` uses. `nylo configure`'s provider sign-in comes from `@earendil-works/pi-ai` (about 100 MB with its provider SDKs), which is not a dependency: the first `nylo configure` installs the tested version into `~/.nylorun/lib/pi-ai-<version>/` with npm, without install scripts, unless it resolves beside nylorun, so `npx nylorun` stays about 11 MB. `nylorun configure`, `nylorun status --env` and `nylorun doctor sandbox` still exit 2, now naming `npx -p nylorun nylo …`. `nylorun status|reset` (the local Tenant's containers and volumes) and `nylo status|reset` (the Management API) keep their meanings; both usages and the README say which is which.
- **Deprecated (`@nylorun/cli`):** its `nylo` prints one line on stderr and runs nylorun's `nylo` with the same arguments and exit code; stdout is unchanged, so `eval "$(npx @nylorun/cli env)"` still works. It depends on `nylorun` only. A later release removes it.
- **Breaking (`@nylorun/admin`): the `./project` subpath is removed.** It re-exported `@nylorun/core/project` for `nylo`, which now imports Core directly. Import `@nylorun/core/project` instead.
- `@nylorun/create-agent`: `compatibility.json` no longer pins `@nylorun/cli`; the examples run `nylo` from their `nylorun` devDependency.
