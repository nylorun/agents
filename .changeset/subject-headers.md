**Act for a person: `Nylorun-Subject` and `Nylorun-Scopes`.** An app server that holds the Tenant key can name the person each request is for, and the Runtime enforces it (optional Host feature `subject-headers`).

- `client.as(subject, { scopes })` in `@nylorun/agents` sends both headers on every call, event streams included. Scopes: `agents:read`, `agents:write`, `sessions:own`, `vaults:own`, `tenant:settings`; default `["sessions:own"]`.
- The Runtime limits a subject to the routes its scopes allow (`403 scope_required`) and to its own sessions and vaults: another owner's session, vault or sandbox is the same `404` as a missing one, including `PUT` on its session id (was `409`). Reset, config seed, executors, actions and the sandbox tool routes are open to no subject. Only application keys may send the headers.
- The AG-UI handler calls the Runtime as each person and requires `subject-headers`; new optional `scopes` option. The host's `session()` parameters can no longer replace a session's id, agent or owner.
- Core exports `SUBJECT_HEADER`, `SCOPES_HEADER`, `SUBJECT_SCOPES` and `parseSubjectHeaders`. Postgres Tenant schemas migrate to version 2 (an indexed session owner column).

Requests without `Nylorun-Subject` are unchanged.
