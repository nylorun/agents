**The Admin API on its own listener.** A Runtime can serve the Admin API on an operator listener, so the port that faces browsers and reverse proxies serves the Tenant API alone. The stack does this by default.

- **Runtime.** With an operator listener (`adminPort` in `host.json`, or `NYLORUN_ADMIN_LISTEN_PORT`, `NYLORUN_ADMIN_LISTEN_HOST` and `NYLORUN_ADMIN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` in a container), the public listener answers `/v1/admin/**` with the opaque `404` and the operator listener serves the Admin API, Host shutdown and the Tenant API, never to browsers. Each checks `Host` against its own port. `/ready` needs both listening; a taken port on either exits with code 98. Without one, a single listener serves everything as before.
- **Stack.** `nylorun start` publishes the operator port on loopback (`NYLORUN_ADMIN_PORT`, default 8788), writes it to `host.json` as `adminPort`, and points Studio at `runtime:4001`. `nylorun status` prints it.
- **Admin client.** Reads `adminPort` from `host.json` and sends Admin API requests there (`admin.adminUrl`); `admin.url` stays the Tenant API URL. A `host.json` without `adminPort` keeps working.
