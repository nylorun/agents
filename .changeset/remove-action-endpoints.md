**Action endpoints are removed (manifest-only agents, M6).** The Runtime runs no code of yours during a session: an agent's tools are HTTP tools, remote MCP servers, agents used as tools and the Runtime's built-ins. Protocol stays 8; the `action-endpoints` feature is gone, so a client that requires it is refused. See MIGRATION.md, "Action endpoints are removed".

- **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`):** the `Action`, endpoint (`PutEndpointsRequest`, `Endpoint`, `EndpointHealth`, …) and delivery schemas, `SIGNATURE_HEADER`, `OUTCOME_HEADER`, `DELIVERY_TOKEN_TYPE` and the `action.*` events (`action.pending`, `.delivered`, `.delivery_failed`, `.completed`, `.uncertain`) are removed, and `ToolDefinition.background` with them. `ActionOutcome` is renamed `EffectOutcome`. Tenant status loses `checks.endpoints`, `agents[].registered` and `agents[].endpoint`, and `counts.pendingActions`; the session view loses `actions`. A `turn.paused` interaction carries the tool call's `callId`. New `codeToolsOf` and `codeToolRefusal` name a definition's tools that would run your code. The Harness API is v2 (`HARNESS_API_VERSION = 2`): `TurnStart.options.holdMs` and `effect.resolved` are removed.
- **Breaking (`@nylorun/harness`):** held runs are gone: `createHarness` loses `holdMs`, and `apiHost` its `hold` option.
- **Breaking (`@nylorun/agents`):** `createActionHandler`, `executeAction`, `createActionSandbox`, `definitionDeclaresSandbox`, `isActionSandboxTool` and the `Action`, `ActionOutcome`, `ActionHandler`, `ActionHandlerOptions`, `RegisterOptions`, `ExecuteActionOptions` and `ExecutableDefinition` types are removed. `saveAgent` refuses a code tool (`tool({ run })`) or a flow tool stage before sending; its `implementationVersion` is optional (`NYLORUN_IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION`, else `dev`).
- **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`):** `/v1/endpoints` and `/v1/actions/*` answer `404`; delivery tokens, the deliverer, background tools, held runs (`TenantConfig.actionHoldMs`), `DurableExecution.deliver`, the Restate `NylorunAction` object, the `action_result` wake and the gates service's `/nylorun/v1/deliveries` are removed, and a migration drops the `actions` and `endpoints` tables. `PUT /v1/agents/:id` refuses a definition with a code tool or a flow tool stage (`400`); a tool the Runtime cannot run fails with `tool.unavailable`. The fixture model answers in text when the agent offers no `lookup_order` tool.
- **Breaking (`@nylorun/cli`):** `nylo endpoints` is removed (a usage error that says why); `nylo status` shows uncertain effects instead of pending Actions.
- **Breaking (`@nylorun/create-agent`):** the starter saves its agent with `saveAgent` and runs no server: no Action endpoint, `PORT` or `NYLORUN_ACTIONS_URL`. Its assistant has no tools, with a commented `http()` tool to start from.
- `nylorun`: the local stack's comments speak of MCP servers and HTTP tools on this machine, not Action endpoints.
- `@nylorun/studio`: the `action.*` event views and delivery status are removed; the chat shows `tool.completed`, and the Agent Manifest tab lists tools without a target as code tools.
