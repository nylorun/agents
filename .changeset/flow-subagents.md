**Flow agents as subagents.** `.subagents(flowAgent)` lets a ReAct agent delegate to a flow agent. The flow's workflow manifest v2 is inlined in the delegating tool (`ToolManifest.agent` may be a workflow manifest), so it is saved with the parent and served by the parent's executor, plugin roots included (`<flow>/<agent>/<capability>`).

- **Engine (harness).** A call to a flow subagent is one durable `agent` effect (`role: "delegate"`) between the delegation's start and settle points; the flow's output is the tool result, and a failed flow is a failed tool result. Local `run()` refuses flow subagents, which need the Runtime.
- **Runtime.** The effect starts a linked flow session from the parent's pinned manifest, fresh per call, and settles when the flow's turn ends. Cancelling any session now cascades to the linked sessions it started, not only a workflow's.
- **Core.** `delegation.flow-unsupported` now only reports a workflow built with `Chain`, `Switch`, `Parallel`, `Map` or `Loop`. New helpers: `flowDelegatesOf`, `flowDelegateManifest`, `isFlowDelegate`; `delegatesOf` lists only the ReAct agents run in-process.
