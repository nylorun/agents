# Changelog

## 0.6.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 50d0fb5: **The Admin API on its own listener.** A Runtime can serve the Admin API on an operator listener, so the port that faces browsers and reverse proxies serves the Tenant API alone. The stack does this by default.

  - **Runtime.** With an operator listener (`adminPort` in `host.json`, or `NYLORUN_ADMIN_LISTEN_PORT`, `NYLORUN_ADMIN_LISTEN_HOST` and `NYLORUN_ADMIN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` in a container), the public listener answers `/v1/admin/**` with the opaque `404` and the operator listener serves the Admin API, Host shutdown and the Tenant API, never to browsers. Each checks `Host` against its own port. `/ready` needs both listening; a taken port on either exits with code 98. Without one, a single listener serves everything as before.
  - **Stack.** `nylorun start` publishes the operator port on loopback (`NYLORUN_ADMIN_PORT`, default 8788), writes it to `host.json` as `adminPort`, and points Studio at `runtime:4001`. `nylorun status` prints it.
  - **Admin client.** Reads `adminPort` from `host.json` and sends Admin API requests there (`admin.adminUrl`); `admin.url` stays the Tenant API URL. A `host.json` without `adminPort` keeps working.

- 9d52189: **Embedding Studio in a desktop app.** Studio can be shown inside a desktop app such as Babai Desktop, in an iframe loaded from its URL and signed in by `postMessage` with a token limited to one Tenant.

  - **`nylorun`.** The local stack lets Babai's origins frame Studio: `NYLORUN_STUDIO_FRAME_ANCESTORS` in `stack/.env` defaults to `nylorun://localhost http://nylorun.localhost` and is passed to the Studio container. `nylorun start --studio-embed-origin <origin>` (repeatable) adds an exact origin, such as a desktop app's dev server, and keeps it across starts until `--studio-embed-origin-reset`. Wildcards are refused. `nylorun status` lists the origins under `Embeds`, and `status --json` as `studio.embedOrigins`.
  - **`@nylorun/admin`.** `mintStudioLoginToken({ studioUrl, adminKey, tenant?, subject? })` mints a single-use Studio login token from an app's backend. With `tenant`, the session it leads to reaches only that Tenant.
  - **Studio.** `POST /_studio/sessions` exchanges such a token for a one-hour bearer session kept in the frame's memory; dashboard pages send `frame-ancestors` from the allowlist instead of `X-Frame-Options: DENY`; `?embed=1` hides Studio's branding, follows the app's theme and routes, and reports its own; `/tenants/:tenant/sessions/:session` opens a session by id. The cookie login of `nylorun studio` is unchanged.

    The dashboard routes `/tenants/:tenant`, `/tenants/:tenant/agents/:agent`, `/tenants/:tenant/agents/:agent/sessions/:session`, `/tenants/:tenant/sessions/:session`, `/tenants/:tenant/vault` and `/tenants/:tenant/settings` are now a public contract for embedders: removing or changing one is a breaking change.

## 0.5.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- db956bc: Studio creates Tenants. While the Host has none, Studio asks for a name and creates the first one. A Tenant with no agents shows **Connect your code**: its model provider, the `npx @nylorun/cli tenant use <id>` command, and `npm run dev`. It switches to the agent list when the first agent registers.

  Every Tenant Studio creates registers the derived principal `project` (`PROJECT_PRINCIPAL_ID` in `@nylorun/admin`). `nylo tenant use` now falls back to that key, derived from the local admin key, so a Project links a Studio-created Tenant with no stored key. When it replaces a one-time application key, it keeps that key as `.nylorun/credentials.<tenantId>.json`, and `nylo tenant use <that id>` switches back. `nylorun up` again offers Studio for creating the first Tenant.

## 0.4.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- a322696: **Derived principals** (optional Host feature `derived-principals`): a client that holds the admin key no longer needs to store an application key.

  - `admin.createTenant({ name, principals: ["babai"] })` registers each named principal by the hash of its derived key, and `admin.deriveTenantKey(tenantId, principalId)` (or `deriveTenantKey(adminKey, tenantId, principalId)`) recomputes the key when needed.
  - `POST /v1/admin/tenants` accepts `derivedPrincipals: [{ id, credentialHash }]`. Ids match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,31}$` and `studio` is reserved; duplicate ids or credentials answer `400`. A retried create must name the same principals.
  - `createTenant` with `principals` throws `incompatible_host` before sending anything to a Host without the feature.

## 0.3.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- bf1c2da: **Tenants can register a Studio principal.** `CreateTenantRequest` gains optional `studioCredentialHash` behind the new protocol feature `studio-principal`; the Runtime stores it as application principal `studio`, and idempotent create compares it too. `@nylorun/admin` exports `deriveStudioToken(adminKey, tenantId)` (HMAC-SHA256 over `nylorun/studio/v1`, NUL, Tenant id) and `createTenant` sends the hash of that key, so Studio can reach any Tenant's API with a key derived from the admin key. Clients require the new feature, so upgrade the Runtime with them.

## 0.2.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- c49efed: **New package:** Admin API client for managing clients (CLI, desktop Runtime panel, CI). Exports `createAdmin` with `createTenant`, `listTenants`, `getTenant`, `deleteTenant`, and `status`. Depends only on `@nylorun/core`. Resolves connection from options, then `NYLORUN_ADMIN_URL`/`NYLORUN_ADMIN_KEY`, then local Host settings (`host.json` + `host-credentials.json`). Developer applications do not depend on this package.
