# Changelog

## 0.10.0-beta

### Major Changes

- bd478ee: **Subject tokens, browser keys and derived principals leave open source (F9 I3, protocol 7).** Upgrade these with the Runtime: they speak protocol 7, which this Runtime serves beside 4, 5 and 6; protocol 6 clients keep working on every route that remains. Browsers and apps present a trusted issuer's token (F9 I2), servers an operator key (F9 I1), and a person's own credentials come from the operator's credential resolver (F9 C1). See MIGRATION.md.

  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`, `@nylorun/core`): subject tokens are gone.** `POST /v1/tokens`, `POST /v1/access/revocations`, subject-token verification, revocation epochs and the `subject.revoked` stream signal are removed; the routes answer `404`, and a JWT no trusted issuer signed is the opaque `404`. A stream opened with a token now ends only at its expiry (`event: nylorun.closed`, reason `token_expired`; `StreamClosedFrame` loses `revoked`). Migration `0010_oss_auth_removals` drops the `subject_epochs`, `subject_usage` and `publishable_keys` tables. The `token` caller is a trusted issuer's token only: it loses `role`, `limits` and `epoch`, and `issuer` is always set; `GET /v1/me` no longer reports `via: token`. Core drops `SUBJECT_TOKEN_TYPE`, `SUBJECT_TOKEN_AUDIENCE`, `subjectTokenIssuer` (the Runtime's own tokens use `tenantTokenIssuer`, same value), `CreateTokenRequest`/`Response`, `RevokeSubject*`, `SubjectTokenClaims`, `TOKEN_TTL_MIN_SECONDS` and `TOKEN_TTL_DEFAULT_SECONDS`; `TOKEN_SCOPES` is `agents:read`, `sessions:own`, `sandboxes:write`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`, `@nylorun/core`): the access policy and role limits are gone.** `GET`/`PUT /v1/access/policy` answer `404`, a turn is never refused with `429 limit_exceeded` for a role (limit requests at your proxy), and an existing `access.policy` setting is ignored. Core drops `AccessPolicy*`, `AccessRole*`, `RoleLimits*`, `DEFAULT_ACCESS_POLICY`, `PutAccessPolicyRequest` and `ROLE_NAME_PATTERN`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`, `@nylorun/core`): publishable keys and the Runtime's CORS are gone.** `/v1/access/publishable-keys*` answer `404`, `Nylorun-Key` is ignored, `NYLORUN_BROWSER_ACCESS` and `browserAccess` (host.json, `createHost`, `startEphemeralRuntime`) are removed, and the Runtime sends no CORS headers. A request with `Origin` reaches the Tenant routes of the public listener with no toggle: a trusted issuer's token is served, an application key or delivery token is `403 origin_rejected`; admin routes, `/health`, `/ready` and the operator listener still refuse `Origin`. Any `OPTIONS` request is `204` with `Allow` and no CORS header: the operator's proxy answers preflights. Route declarations lose `browser` (`x-nylorun-browser` leaves the OpenAPI document) and the `publishable` credential; the token security scheme is `issuerToken`. Core drops `PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HEADER`, `PUBLISHABLE_KEY_PATTERN`, `PUBLISHABLE_KEY_ID_PATTERN`, `tenantOfPublishableKey`, `newPublishableKey`, `newPublishableKeyId`, `PublishableKey*`, `OriginEntrySchema`, `originAllowed` and `LOOPBACK_ORIGIN_WILDCARDS`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`, `@nylorun/core`, `@nylorun/agents`): vault routes are application-only, and `vaults:own` is retired.** Every `/v1/vaults` route takes an application key acting for no one (operator keys, Studio); a request acting for a subject or a trusted issuer's token gets `403 scope_required`. `vaults:own` leaves `SUBJECT_SCOPES`, `TOKEN_SCOPES` and the issuer scopes; `Nylorun-Scopes` may still name it and it grants nothing. Existing user vaults stay attachable to their own owner's sessions. `client.createVault` takes `{ scope: "installation" }` or `ownerUserId`, and `client.listVaults()` takes an optional owner.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`, `@nylorun/core`, `@nylorun/admin`, `nylorun`): derived principals are gone.** Only Studio's key is derived from the admin key. `NYLORUN_DERIVED_PRINCIPALS` is ignored and no longer written, `hostPrincipals` takes no `derived`, `startEphemeralRuntime` no `derivedPrincipals`, and `@nylorun/admin` drops `deriveTenantKey`, `PROJECT_PRINCIPAL_ID` and `admin.deriveTenantKey`. Keys an earlier Host derived stay in the database and keep working as ordinary keys; replace them with operator keys. Core renames `DERIVED_PRINCIPAL_ID_PATTERN` to `APPLICATION_KEY_ID_PATTERN`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/agents`):** `createTokenEndpoint`, `createBrowserClient` and the `@nylorun/agents/browser` entry, `client.tokens`, `TokensClient`, `PublishableKeysClient`, `client.access.getPolicy`/`putPolicy`/`revokeSubject`/`publishableKeys` and `Destination.publishableKey` are removed. `client.access.signingKeys` and `client.access.jwks()` stay, and `Destination.token` takes a trusted issuer's tokens.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/cli`):** `nylo access policy|keys|revoke|token` are removed and name what replaces them; `nylo access signing-keys list|rotate|revoke` stays.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`, `@nylorun/agents`, `@nylorun/studio`): the Studio embed message `open.babai` is now `open.session`** (`{ sessionId }`): it asks the embedding app to open that session in its own UI. Studio sends no such message itself.
  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): Studio embedding is opt-in.** No origin may frame Studio by default; list your app's origins with `nylorun start --studio-embed-origin <origin>`. A Tenant's `.env` from an earlier nylorun keeps the origins it had until `--studio-embed-origin-reset`.
  - `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 7 and `HOST_PROTOCOL` 4–7; the Host features `subject-tokens`, `browser-access` and `derived-principals` are removed. `@nylorun/studio` and `@nylorun/create-agent` speak protocol 7.

### Minor Changes

- 5cfaed9: **Operator keys, and project links on them (F9 I1).** The Admin API manages the Tenant's application keys by name: `PUT /v1/admin/keys/{id}` creates a key or rotates it and returns it once, `GET /v1/admin/keys` lists every key's id, role and issue time (never the keys), and `DELETE /v1/admin/keys/{id}` removes one. A rotated or deleted key stops authenticating on its next request. Ids follow `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,31}$`; `studio` (derived from the admin key) is refused. Keys keep today's format (64 hex) and only their SHA-256 is stored, in the existing principals table (no migration). Host feature `operator-keys` (additive, protocol unchanged); core adds the `OperatorKey`, `ListOperatorKeysResponse`, `PutOperatorKeyResponse` and `DeleteOperatorKeyResponse` schemas.

  - `@nylorun/admin`: `admin.keys.put(id)`, `admin.keys.list()` and `admin.keys.delete(id)`; they refuse with `incompatible_host` when the Host lacks `operator-keys`.
  - `nylorun key put|list|rm <id>` manages a running local Tenant's keys; `put` prints the key once on stdout.
  - `nylorun start` no longer derives the project's key. It keeps `.nylorun/credentials.json` while its key still reaches the Tenant (one authenticated read); otherwise it gives the project the operator key `project`, which the Host root keeps in `project-credentials.json` (0600) so every checkout linked to the Tenant shares it. An existing derived project key keeps working and is adopted.
  - `nylorun sandbox` uses the linked project's key, or the operator key `cli` it puts once and keeps in `<Host root>/cli-credentials.json` (0600).
  - The ephemeral Runtime (`startEphemeralRuntime`) no longer registers the derived `project` principal; pass `derivedPrincipals: ["project"]` to keep it. Derived principals (`NYLORUN_DERIVED_PRINCIPALS`, `deriveTenantKey`) still work on a Host.

## 0.9.0-beta

### Major Changes

- b352feb: **File artifacts, message parts and capability links (protocol 6).** Upgrade these with the Runtime: they speak protocol 6, which this Runtime serves beside 4 and 5. See MIGRATION.md.

  - **`@nylorun/runtime`: file artifacts.** A file is an artifact: an `af_` id, a name and numbered immutable versions, with rows in the new `artifacts` and `artifact_versions` tables (migration `0004_artifacts`) and bytes in the Object store (`BlobStore`). `POST /v1/artifacts?name=&sessionId=` uploads a file in one streamed request and `POST /v1/artifacts/{id}/versions` adds a version, within the Tenant's limits (`GET`/`PUT /v1/tenant/artifacts`: 100 MiB per file and 10 GiB in all by default); a body past either is `413 limit_exceeded`, refused mid-stream with nothing stored. `GET /v1/artifacts` lists them (by session), `GET /v1/artifacts/{id}` reads one with its versions, `GET /v1/artifacts/{id}/versions/{n|latest}/content` downloads through the Runtime with HTTP Range (`206`, `Content-Range`, `416`), and `DELETE /v1/artifacts/{id}` deletes it with its bytes. A session's artifacts go with it on a sessions reset, and appear in its history as `artifact.created`, `artifact.version.created` and `artifact.deleted` (new in the event catalog). A subject reaches only the artifacts of their own sessions.
  - **`@nylorun/runtime`: capability links.** `POST /v1/artifacts/{id}/links` mints a short-lived path, `/v1/artifact-links/<token>`, that downloads one version (with Range) with no credential and no `Nylorun-Protocol`: an ES256 JWT (`typ: nylorun-artifact+jwt`) signed with the Tenant's signing key, at most 15 minutes, and dead once the artifact is deleted. The Host logs its path without the token.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/core`, `@nylorun/runtime`): message `parts`.** A user message may carry `parts`: `text`, and `file` by `artifactId` (and `version`, else the latest, pinned when the message is accepted). Model-gate reads the file from the Object store: an image goes to the model as image input, a text file as text, and any other file fails the call (`invalid_request`). The record and the transcript hold only the reference. The gateway builds its `BlobStore` from `NYLORUN_OBJECT_STORE_*` (the Tenant's `fs` store without it). `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 6; `HOST_PROTOCOL` is 4–6 and protocol 6 clients require the feature `artifacts`.
  - **`@nylorun/runtime`: `save_artifact`.** A session with a sandbox gets the `nylorun.artifacts` capability, whose `save_artifact` tool saves a sandbox file (`path`) or text (`content`) as an artifact of the session, carrying the turn and tool call on its event.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/runtime`): `MediaStore` is removed.** `MediaStore` and `localMedia` leave `@nylorun/runtime/node`, and `piModel` takes `files` (a resolver from an artifact reference to its bytes) instead of `media`; images are file artifacts. The image checks (`decodeImageBase64`, `validateImageBytes`, `IMAGE_MEDIA_TYPES`, `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`) stay.
  - **`@nylorun/agents`:** `client.artifacts` (`upload`, `uploadVersion`, `list`, `get`, `download` with a range, `link`, `delete`), also on `BrowserClient`, and `session.inputParts(parts)`. A request with a body of its own type keeps it.
  - `@nylorun/admin`, `@nylorun/cli`, `nylorun`, `@nylorun/studio`: speak protocol 6.

## 0.8.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 4b9906f: **Breaking: "Tenant" replaces "stack", and `nylorun start` works anywhere.** Each local installation holds one Tenant, and its name is the Tenant's name, so help, output, errors and docs say Tenant. See MIGRATION.md.

  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): selection.** Every command acts on the Tenant `--tenant <name>` names (replaces `--name`, which is removed), else `NYLORUN_TENANT` (replaces `NYLORUN_STACK`), else the Project link's `tenant`; `start` in a project names a new one after the project directory. Outside a project, or with `start --no-link`, commands act on the Tenant `default`. In a project without a link, commands other than `start` exit 2 and list the machine's Tenants. A name starting with `tn_` (a Tenant id) is refused.
  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): files.** Host roots are under `~/.nylorun/tenants/<name>/` (was `~/.nylorun/stacks/<name>/`) with `tenant.json` (was `stack.json`); the `.env` key is `NYLORUN_TENANT_NAME` (was `NYLORUN_STACK_NAME`); `NYLORUN_COMPOSE_PROJECT` replaces `NYLORUN_STACK_PROJECT`. Compose projects stay `nylorun-<name>`. Every command first moves 0.4 Host roots from `~/.nylorun/stacks/` to `~/.nylorun/tenants/` (renaming `stack.json` and the `.env` key), so they keep their volumes and keys. `nylorun ls` lists only directories with `tenant.json`.
  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): removed.** `nylorun legacy` and all handling of the single stack of releases before 0.4; the hidden `nylorun stack <cmd>` alias; `nylorun doctor stack|runtime`. Output says Tenant: `ls` prints `TENANT` and JSON `{ "tenants": [...] }`, `status` prints the Tenant id on its own line, and `doctor`'s row is `tenant`.
  - **Breaking: Project link format 3.** `.nylorun/link.json` is `{ "format": 3, "tenant", "tenantId", "hostUrl", "hostId" }`; `tenant` replaces `stack`. `@nylorun/agents`, `@nylorun/cli` and `@nylorun/admin` refuse an older link and name `npx nylorun start`, which rewrites it. `@nylorun/core`'s `ProjectLinkFileSchema` parses formats 0–3 with `tenant`.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/admin`):** `createAdmin({ tenant })` replaces `{ stack }`, `tenantHostRoot(name)` replaces `stackHostRoot(name)`, and local resolution reads `NYLORUN_TENANT` and the link's `tenant`.
  - `@nylorun/cli`: `status` and `endpoints` drop the `stack` line and JSON key; messages say Tenant. `@nylorun/agents`: a Runtime too old for the client says "update the Runtime (npx nylorun@latest start)". `@nylorun/studio`: setup hints say Tenant. `@nylorun/create-agent`: the next steps describe `npx nylorun@beta start` as this project's Tenant and its link.

## 0.7.0-beta

### Major Changes

- 5ca1923: **Clients for one Tenant per installation: a stack per project, nothing selects a Tenant.** Upgrade these with the Runtime; they speak protocol 5. Existing stacks are left as they are: see MIGRATION.md.

  - **Breaking (`nylorun`): one stack per project.** `nylorun start` in a project creates the project's stack (named after the project directory, or `--name`; Host root `~/.nylorun/stacks/<name>/`, Compose project `nylorun-<name>`, its own free ports and volumes), waits for its Runtime to create the stack's Tenant, writes the Project link (`.nylorun/link.json` format 2: `stack`, `hostUrl`, `hostId`, `tenantId`) and `.nylorun/credentials.json` (the key of the derived principal `project`, derived from the stack's admin key), and seeds the model provider from the project's `.env`. `nylorun ls` lists the machine's stacks and `nylorun delete <name>` removes one with its volumes and Host root. `nylorun status` shows the stack's Tenant; `nylorun studio` opens it. The old single stack under `~/.nylorun` is never touched: `start` notes it, and `nylorun legacy stop|delete` handles it. Every stack command takes `--name <stack>` (or `NYLORUN_STACK`, or the Project link's stack); `start --no-link` starts a stack without linking the directory; `nylorun reset` resets the selected stack only. The runtime container's healthcheck is now `/health`, so a Tenant that cannot open is reported by `start` from the Admin status at once instead of after a 300 s wait. `NYLORUN_HOME` still overrides the Host root. Stacks start and stop only when you say so.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/cli`): no Tenant commands.** `nylo tenant create|use|list|current|delete` are removed; `nylo status`, `nylo reset` and `nylo endpoints` replace `nylo tenant status|reset|endpoints` on the linked installation. `nylo env` prints `NYLORUN_RUNTIME_URL` and `NYLORUN_SERVER_KEY` only. `nylo` no longer writes Project links.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/agents`): no Tenant to name.** The `tenant` option (`createClient`, `Transport`, `resolveConnection`, `createActionHandler({ runtime })`, `JwksCache`) and `NYLORUN_TENANT` are gone, and no request sends `Nylorun-Tenant`; a connection is a URL and a key. A Project link of format 0 or 1 is refused with `connection_missing`, naming `npx nylorun start`. `verifyDeliveryToken`'s `tenantId` is optional: without it any Tenant issuer is accepted, since the installation's keys bind it. `TENANT_HEADER` is no longer re-exported.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/admin`): status only.** `createTenant`, `listTenants`, `getTenant` and `deleteTenant` are removed; `status().tenant` names the Host's Tenant, and `deriveTenantKey` / `deriveStudioToken` derive its keys. Local Host resolution reads the stack's Host root (`stack` option, `NYLORUN_STACK`, or the Project link's `stack`); `NYLORUN_HOME` and `home` still override it. `stackHostRoot(name)` is exported.
  - **Breaking (`@nylorun/studio`): Studio serves its installation's Tenant.** The Tenant picker, list and create are gone, with `/_studio/tenants`; `/` opens `/tenants/<id>`. The `/tenants/:tenant` routes and the login token's `tenant` claim stay for embedders and must name that Tenant. The proxy sends no `Nylorun-Tenant`.
  - **`@nylorun/create-agent`:** the next steps are `npx nylorun start`, then `npm run dev`.
  - `@nylorun/core`: `ProjectLinkFileSchema` accepts format 2 with `stack`, and `tenantId` is optional; `ERROR_CODES` loses `tenant_conflict` and `active_work`.

- 5ca1923: **One Tenant per installation: a database per Tenant, protocol 5.** A Runtime serves exactly one Tenant, the one its Postgres database holds. Two Tenants are two installations.

  - **Breaking: fresh start.** The Tenant's state is in the fixed schema `nylorun` of its own database and its record in `nylorun_streams`, keyed by session (no `tenant_id`). A database written by an earlier Runtime (`tenant_<id>` schemas, or a record keyed by Tenant) is refused: the Host stays up but not ready, and `/v1/admin/status` names the cause `database-layout-old`. Point the Runtime at a new database (with the local stack, a new stack); the old one is never changed.
  - **The Host creates its Tenant** on first start, in the migration transaction: `NYLORUN_TENANT_ID` (default a new id), `NYLORUN_TENANT_NAME` (default `default`), the Studio principal and the derived principals of `NYLORUN_DERIVED_PRINCIPALS` (comma-separated, default `project`), whose keys the admin key derives (`deriveTenantKey`). Later starts open the same Tenant and add derived principals configured since.
  - **Breaking: no Tenant catalog.** `/v1/admin/tenants` and `/v1/admin/tenants/{tenantId}` are gone (404). `AdminStatus.tenants[]` is replaced by `AdminStatus.tenant` (`id`, `name`, `state: open | unavailable`, `envelope`, and `cause` when it could not be opened). `CreateTenantRequestSchema`, `AdminTenantSchema`, `AdminTenantStatusSchema`, `AdminTenantListSchema` and `QuarantineSchema` leave `@nylorun/core`; `HostTenantSchema` and `TenantCauseSchema` replace them. `@nylorun/admin`'s `listTenants`, `getTenant`, `deleteTenant` and `createTenant` are removed (see below).
  - **Readiness instead of quarantine.** A Tenant that cannot be opened (`schema-too-new`, `kek-missing`, `migration-failed`, `envelope-invalid`, `database-layout-old`, …) fails `/ready` (check `tenant`, which replaces `discovery`) and is reported with its repair in `/v1/admin/status` and the log; every Tenant request gets the opaque 404. A failure outside it (Postgres unreachable) is retried.
  - **Protocol 5.** `PROTOCOL_VERSION = 5`; the Host serves protocols 4 and 5 for one release. Clients no longer require `runtime-tenants`; the Host still advertises it. No request needs `Nylorun-Tenant`: a request without it reaches the Host's Tenant, and one naming another Tenant (or a malformed one), or a publishable key of another Tenant, gets the opaque 404. The OpenAPI documents drop the header parameter and the Admin Tenant routes.
  - **Paths.** The Tenant directory is `<Host root>/tenant/` (was `tenants/<id>/`); `trash/` and the SQLite move to it are gone. The gates service serves its database's Tenant, and its `Nylorun-Tenant` header is optional (when sent, it must name that Tenant).
  - **Breaking: `startEphemeralRuntime` needs a database; the in-memory Session Store is removed.** `StartEphemeralRuntimeOptions.database` is required: a Postgres URL, for which the Runtime opens a pool and ends it on `close()`, or a pool the caller ends. It creates its Tenant in that database through the same bootstrap as a Host, or serves the Tenant the database already holds; the data stays after `close()`, so give each test Tenant a database of its own. Durable Streams and scheduling stay in process. See `MIGRATION.md`.

## 0.6.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 50d0fb5: **The Admin API on its own listener.** A Runtime can serve the Admin API on an operator listener, so the port that faces browsers and reverse proxies serves the Tenant API alone. The stack does this by default.

  - **Runtime.** With an operator listener (`adminPort` in `host.json`, or `NYLORUN_ADMIN_LISTEN_PORT`, `NYLORUN_ADMIN_LISTEN_HOST` and `NYLORUN_ADMIN_ALLOWED_HOSTS` in a container), the public listener answers `/v1/admin/**` with the opaque `404` and the operator listener serves the Admin API, Host shutdown and the Tenant API, never to browsers. Each checks `Host` against its own port. `/ready` needs both listening; a taken port on either exits with code 98. Without one, a single listener serves everything as before.
  - **Stack.** `nylorun start` publishes the operator port on loopback (`NYLORUN_ADMIN_PORT`, default 8788), writes it to `host.json` as `adminPort`, and points Studio at `runtime:4001`. `nylorun status` prints it.
  - **Admin client.** Reads `adminPort` from `host.json` and sends Admin API requests there (`admin.adminUrl`); `admin.url` stays the Tenant API URL. A `host.json` without `adminPort` keeps working.

- 9d52189: **Embedding Studio in a desktop app.** Studio can be shown inside a desktop app such as Babai Desktop, in an iframe loaded from its URL and signed in by `postMessage` with a token limited to one Tenant.

  - **`nylorun`.** The local stack lets Babai's origins frame Studio: `NYLORUN_STUDIO_FRAME_ANCESTORS` in `stack/.env` defaults to `nylorun://localhost http://nylorun.localhost` and is passed to the Studio container. `nylorun start --studio-embed-origin <origin>` (repeatable) adds an exact origin, such as a desktop app's dev server, and keeps it across starts until `--studio-embed-origin-reset`. Wildcards are refused. `nylorun status` lists the origins under `Embeds`, and `status --json` as `studio.embedOrigins`.
  - **`@nylorun/admin`.** `mintStudioLoginToken({ studioUrl, adminKey, tenant?, subject? })` mints a single-use Studio login token from an app's backend. With `tenant`, the session it leads to reaches only that Tenant.
  - **Studio.** `POST /_studio/sessions` exchanges such a token for a one-hour bearer session kept in the frame's memory; dashboard pages send `frame-ancestors` from the allowlist instead of `X-Frame-Options: DENY`; `?embed=1` hides Studio's branding, follows the app's theme and routes, and reports its own; `/tenants/:tenant/sessions/:session` opens a session by id. The cookie login of `nylorun studio` is unchanged.

    The dashboard routes `/tenants/:tenant`, `/tenants/:tenant/agents/:agent`, `/tenants/:tenant/agents/:agent/sessions/:session`, `/tenants/:tenant/sessions/:session`, `/tenants/:tenant/vault` and `/tenants/:tenant/settings` are now a public contract for embedders: removing or changing one is a breaking change.

## 0.5.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- db956bc: Studio creates Tenants. While the Host has none, Studio asks for a name and creates the first one. A Tenant with no agents shows **Connect your code**: its model provider, the `npx @nylorun/cli tenant use <id>` command, and `npm run dev`. It switches to the agent list when the first agent registers.

  Every Tenant Studio creates registers the derived principal `project` (`PROJECT_PRINCIPAL_ID` in `@nylorun/admin`). `nylo tenant use` now falls back to that key, derived from the local admin key, so a Project links a Studio-created Tenant with no stored key. When it replaces a one-time application key, it keeps that key as `.nylorun/credentials.<tenantId>.json`, and `nylo tenant use <that id>` switches back. `nylorun up` again offers Studio for creating the first Tenant.

## 0.4.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- a322696: **Derived principals** (optional Host feature `derived-principals`): a client that holds the admin key no longer needs to store an application key.

  - `admin.createTenant({ name, principals: ["babai"] })` registers each named principal by the hash of its derived key, and `admin.deriveTenantKey(tenantId, principalId)` (or `deriveTenantKey(adminKey, tenantId, principalId)`) recomputes the key when needed.
  - `POST /v1/admin/tenants` accepts `derivedPrincipals: [{ id, credentialHash }]`. Ids match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,31}$` and `studio` is reserved; duplicate ids or credentials answer `400`. A retried create must name the same principals.
  - `createTenant` with `principals` throws `incompatible_host` before sending anything to a Host without the feature.

## 0.3.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- bf1c2da: **Tenants can register a Studio principal.** `CreateTenantRequest` gains optional `studioCredentialHash` behind the new protocol feature `studio-principal`; the Runtime stores it as application principal `studio`, and idempotent create compares it too. `@nylorun/admin` exports `deriveStudioToken(adminKey, tenantId)` (HMAC-SHA256 over `nylorun/studio/v1`, NUL, Tenant id) and `createTenant` sends the hash of that key, so Studio can reach any Tenant's API with a key derived from the admin key. Clients require the new feature, so upgrade the Runtime with them.

### Minor Changes

- c49efed: **New package:** Admin API client for managing clients (CLI, desktop Runtime panel, CI). Exports `createAdmin` with `createTenant`, `listTenants`, `getTenant`, `deleteTenant`, and `status`. Depends only on `@nylorun/core`. Resolves connection from options, then `NYLORUN_ADMIN_URL`/`NYLORUN_ADMIN_KEY`, then local Host settings (`host.json` + `host-credentials.json`). Developer applications do not depend on this package.
