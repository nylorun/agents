# nylorun

## 0.2.1-beta

### Patch Changes

- db956bc: Studio creates Tenants. While the Host has none, Studio asks for a name and creates the first one. A Tenant with no agents shows **Connect your code**: its model provider, the `npx @nylorun/cli tenant use <id>` command, and `npm run dev`. It switches to the agent list when the first agent registers.

  Every Tenant Studio creates registers the derived principal `project` (`PROJECT_PRINCIPAL_ID` in `@nylorun/admin`). `nylo tenant use` now falls back to that key, derived from the local admin key, so a Project links a Studio-created Tenant with no stored key. When it replaces a one-time application key, it keeps that key as `.nylorun/credentials.<tenantId>.json`, and `nylo tenant use <that id>` switches back. `nylorun up` again offers Studio for creating the first Tenant.

- Pin studio to the tested release.

## 0.2.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- c82aa6f: `nylorun up` prints Studio as `http://localhost:<port>`, with no login token in it, and in a terminal opens Studio in the browser already signed in (`--no-open` keeps the browser closed). The Studio sign-in lasts 30 days and survives Studio restarts: the session cookie is signed with a key derived from the admin key instead of being held in memory. `nylorun studio` prints the plain URL when it opens the browser; `nylorun studio --no-open` still prints the single-use login URL.

### Patch Changes

- 5e4947a: `nylorun up` no longer says a Tenant can be created in Studio, which has no way to create one. While the Host has no Tenant, it names `npx @nylorun/cli tenant create` alone.
- Pin studio to the tested release.

## 0.1.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- ba1b239: **`nylorun` sets up the local stack; `@nylorun/cli` becomes the Runtime client `nylo` (breaking beta).**

  - New unscoped package **`nylorun`**: `npx nylorun up` sets up the Docker stack on the first run and starts it after that, from any directory; `npx nylorun down` stops it (volumes are kept). `up` and `down` are aliases of `start` and `stop`. It also owns `status`, `logs`, `studio`, `reset` and `doctor`, pins the Runtime and Studio images (`package.json` `nylorun.runtime` / `nylorun.studio`), depends on `@nylorun/core` only, and never creates Tenants.
  - **`@nylorun/cli`** is the Runtime client with the command **`nylo`**: `nylo tenant create [name]` (creates the Tenant; in a project, writes the Project link and seeds the model provider and sandbox from `.env`), `nylo tenant current|list|use|status|reset|delete`, `nylo configure`, `nylo env` (was `nylorun status --env`) and `nylo doctor sandbox`. It no longer provides the `nylorun` command or the stack commands.
  - **Removed:** `nylorun dev` and `nylorun dev --ephemeral`. Link once with `nylo tenant create`, then run the project's own `npm run dev`. Moved commands exit 2 and name their replacement.
  - **Starter:** the generated project depends on `@nylorun/agents` only (no Nylorun devDependency); `dev` is `tsx watch --env-file-if-exists=.env src/main.ts`. `npm create @nylorun/agent` installs the project and prints the next steps (`npx nylorun up`, `npx @nylorun/cli tenant create`, `npm run dev`) instead of starting development; `--no-open` is accepted and ignored.
  - `connectAgents` names those steps when it finds no Runtime connection. Runtime repair hints, model errors and core's sandbox message name `nylo` and `nylorun up`.
