## 0.21.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 6ab4c59: **Long sessions on any model: compaction.** A session whose history outgrows the model's context window keeps going, on a 16k local model as on a 1M hosted one.

  - **Compaction.**
    - **When.** Before each model call the engine estimates the prompt: the last reported usage, plus about four characters per token for what came after. If the estimate would not leave room for the reply, the engine first compacts: it asks the model to summarize the older history, then keeps about the newest 20,000 tokens (at most 30% of the window) verbatim.
    - **What it keeps.** The cut never separates a tool call from its result. The current turn's request is always kept. A later compaction merges with the earlier summary.
    - **Overflow.** If a provider still reports a context overflow, the engine compacts once and asks again.
    - **Storage.** The summary is a `compaction` transcript entry that replaces the older entries in the session state; the event log keeps the full history. The summary call is a journaled model effect, so replays are deterministic.
    - **New event.** `context.compacted` (`trigger`, `tokensBefore`, `tokensAfter`).
  - **Custom endpoints.**
    - **Settings.** Model Settings take `settings: { contextWindow, maxTokens, reasoning, compat }` for a custom OpenAI-compatible provider (vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, Ollama, LM Studio). `compat` is passed to pi-ai: `thinkingFormat`, `thinkingTokenBudgetField`, `chatTemplateKwargs` and the rest.
    - **Defaults.** Without settings, a custom endpoint is assumed to have a 32k window and an 8k output limit. They used to be 128k and 16k.
    - **Where to set them.** `nylo configure` asks for the window and output limit. Studio's Model Settings shows all four fields.
  - **Storage.**
    - Model effects no longer journal the model request next to the call, so each call's prompt is stored once.
    - When a turn ends, its model effects are slimmed to their identity and status; the transcript holds the answers.
    - Session storage now grows with the window, not with the square of the session's length.
  - **Core.**
    - `TranscriptEntry` adds `compaction` (`TranscriptCompactionEntry`).
    - `ModelAdapterContext.compaction` marks a summary call.
    - `CustomModelSettings` / `CustomModelSettingsSchema` describe the custom endpoint settings.

- 6ab4c59: **Model calls don't strand sessions.** A model provider failure is now a known outcome, not a lost call. The Runtime retries what can be retried, and otherwise fails the turn with `model.<code>`, so the session accepts the next message instead of sitting `uncertain` until it is cancelled.

  - **Runtime.**

    - **Upgrade.** The model adapter moves to pi-ai 0.99.1 and always streams.
    - **Per-call settings.**
      - Every call carries the session id, so OpenAI and other providers reuse the prompt cache and route to the same backend.
      - Provider auth no longer reads the process environment.
      - Rate limits, overloads, timeouts and transient errors are retried: 3 attempts with backoff, honouring `Retry-After`.
      - A stream that produces nothing for 300 s is aborted and retried. `TenantConfig.modelCall` sets attempts, backoff, the idle timeout and the request timeout.
    - **Failures.** Anything else fails the turn with one of these codes:

      - `model.context_overflow`, `model.rate_limited`, `model.overloaded`, `model.timeout`, `model.transient`
      - `model.content_policy`, `model.auth` (whose message says where to fix the credential)
      - `model.invalid_request`, `model.invalid_output`

      Only a call whose outcome was lost, such as a Worker dying mid-call, is still `uncertain`.

    - **Structured output.** A structured final answer is repaired (control characters, a Markdown code fence) before it is parsed.
    - **Model history.** Replayed history keeps the model that produced each message, so a model switch no longer sends one model's signatures or tool-call ids to another. Reasoning from OpenAI-compatible servers (`reasoning_content`, `reasoning`) is sent back only within the turn that produced it.

  - **Events.**
    - `message.assistant` adds `model` (`provider`, `model`), `finishReason` and `usage`.
    - A new `model.failed` transcript event (`code`, `message`, `retryable`) is written instead of `message.assistant` when a call fails.
  - **Core and harness.**
    - New types and helpers: `ModelFailureOutcome`, `ModelFailureCode`, `MODEL_FAILURE_CODES`, `isModelFailureOutcome`, `ModelProducer`.
    - `PromptItem` assistant messages may carry `producer`.
    - `ModelUsage` adds `cacheWriteTokens`.
    - A model adapter may return a failure outcome.
    - The durable engine version is `hosted-3`: a turn that is running when the Runtime is upgraded fails once with `execution.incompatible`, and the next message works.
  - **CLI.**
    - `nylo configure` passes a stable installation id to OAuth logins that need one (OpenAI "Sign in with ChatGPT"), stored as `cli-installation-id` in the Host root.
    - A custom OpenAI-compatible provider now prompts for its API key instead of failing.

- 6ab4c59: **Long turns roll over.** A turn no longer fails when it runs past the 50-minute advance deadline.

  - **How it works.** At a step boundary with no open work, a long turn ends its segment and continues in the next one: same turn, a new checkpoint, woken at once. By default this happens after 50 steps or 20 minutes in a segment; `TenantConfig.rollover` changes both.
  - **What clients see.** A rolled-over turn emits no `turn.*` event, and clients still see one turn.
  - **Storage.** Each finished segment's model effects are slimmed.
  - **Harness.** `runDurable` takes `yieldAfter: { steps, ms }` and can return `yielded`, and `RunResult` adds `yielded`. The durable host writes the next checkpoint at `segment + 1` with `{ kind: "continue" }`. Agents used as tools never roll over.

## 0.20.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 5278b4e: **Flow agents on workflow manifest v2.** A flow agent compiles to `workflowSchemaVersion: 2` and runs on the new `flow-2` engine; v1 workflows (`Chain`, `Switch`, `Parallel`, `Map`, `Loop`) keep running on `flow-1`, so in-flight runs finish as they began.

  - **Manifest (core).** Any node may carry `id` and `input`; there are no slots. `chain` and `parallel` are bare collections, a Map is `{ map: { each } }` over its input, and a Loop has `max?` and `decide?`. The header adds `name`, `description`, `metadata`, `inputSchema` and `outputSchema`, and `agents` embeds every agent the flow runs, so one manifest hash covers the whole flow. `Agent.from(json, { nodes, agents })` rebuilds a flow agent. Path and key helpers (`leafPath`, `stageKey`, `forEachFlowNode`, `embeddedAgent`, …) are exported from `@nylorun/core/define`.
  - **Paths (harness).** Linked agent sessions are named by the agent: its id, `[i]` per Map item, and a nested flow agent's id in front. Control stages add nothing, so wrapping a step in a Loop keeps its session. Functions are bound under stage keys (`route:on`, `@1.default.1:input`) and all receive `{ input, results, flowInput }`; `flowInput` works inside nested `flow()`. A Loop without `decide` retries with the verifier's feedback up to `max` and then fails with `loop.exhausted`. Nested flow agents run inline.
  - **Runtime.** Leaves of a v2 workflow resolve from its embedded `agents` (with the workflow's plugin roots, keyed `<agent>/<capability>`) instead of the registry. `loop.iteration` is emitted only for a Loop's own agent turns.
  - **Agents SDK.** `saveAgent(flowAgent)` PUTs one document; application mode registers the flow's executor with its manifest hash. An executor leaves `fn`, `verify` and tool actions of a v2 flow unclaimed when they belong to another manifest hash, because stage keys can shift between deploys; it reports each skipped action once through `onError`.
  - **Studio.** Draws v2 manifests: agents and tools at their session paths, control stages at their stage keys, nested flow agents inline, and lights a Map's agent from its item sessions.
  - Build diagnostics: `flow.duplicate-leaf`, `flow.duplicate-id`, `flow.agent-conflict`, `flow.v1-workflow`, `loop.invalid-verify`, `workflow.flow-agent-child`. Also fixes v1 flows passing an agent step's output to the next step still wrapped in the runtime's turn marker.

- 426fd27: **Flow agents as subagents.** `.subagents(flowAgent)` lets a ReAct agent delegate to a flow agent. The flow's workflow manifest v2 is inlined in the delegating tool (`ToolManifest.agent` may be a workflow manifest), so it is saved with the parent and served by the parent's executor, plugin roots included (`<flow>/<agent>/<capability>`).

  - **Engine (harness).** A call to a flow subagent is one durable `agent` effect (`role: "delegate"`) between the delegation's start and settle points; the flow's output is the tool result, and a failed flow is a failed tool result. Local `run()` refuses flow subagents, which need the Runtime.
  - **Runtime.** The effect starts a linked flow session from the parent's pinned manifest, fresh per call, and settles when the flow's turn ends. Cancelling any session now cascades to the linked sessions it started, not only a workflow's.
  - **Core.** `delegation.flow-unsupported` now only reports a workflow built with `Chain`, `Switch`, `Parallel`, `Map` or `Loop`. New helpers: `flowDelegatesOf`, `flowDelegateManifest`, `isFlowDelegate`; `delegatesOf` lists only the ReAct agents run in-process.

### Patch Changes

- 8cda500: **Workflow functions and tool steps reach the executor.** Several workflow nodes asked the executor for a key that core never registered, so the executor never found the function and the turn waited forever.

  - A Map's `over` and a slot's `input` now use the keys core registers (`<path>/over`, `<path>/input`), as Switch's `on` already did.
  - A slot `input` that wraps a Map or Switch gets its own effect id, so it no longer collides with the `over` or `on` effect on the same path.
  - A slot `id` that renames a nested workflow now renames the keys inside it too.
  - A verifier slot's `input` is keyed under the verifier's path (`<loop>/<part>/input`).
  - A tool step passes its output to the next step, not the `{ kind: "completed", output }` outcome around it. A denied tool call fails the flow with `tool.denied`.

## 0.19.2-beta

### Patch Changes

- a322696: **The session log now carries what a chat UI shows** (optional Host feature `transcript-events`).

  - `message.assistant` for each completed model step: `{ invocationId, text, toolCalls: [{ callId, name, input }], agent? }`.
  - `tool.completed` for an MCP or sandbox tool: `{ invocationId, callId, capabilityId, toolName, output }`, or `error: { code, message }` for a tool error.
  - Tool `action.pending` and `action.completed` events, and `delegation.started` / `delegation.completed`, carry the model's `callId` (and `invocationId` on actions).
  - Events are written in the transaction that completes the effect, so a replay writes none.
  - `@nylorun/core/contracts` adds payload schemas and `parseTranscriptEvent(event)`; `LiveEvent.payload` stays `unknown`.

  Fix: a tool with both `approval` and an `output` schema now pauses for approval. The Runtime validated its `interaction-required` result against the output schema and failed the tool with `tool.invalid-output`; `denied`, `interaction-required` and `deferred` results are no longer validated.

## 0.19.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- fd9fd87: Add workflows: compose agents and `tool()` with `Chain`, `Switch`, `Parallel`, `Map`, and `Loop`. A workflow is a registered runnable (`kind: "workflow"`) with the same session API as an agent — `export const agents`, `saveAgent` (saves referenced agents first), `createSession`, `input` (`content` or `data`), `observe({ follow })`, `pending`, `approve`, `cancel`. Slots (`{ run, id?, input? }`) reshape data between nodes. The flow engine (`runFlowDurable`) returns effects only; `harness/src/loop/` and `runDurable` are unchanged.

  HostEffect gains flow kinds `agent`, `tool` (node), `fn`, and `verify`, each with `path`, `key`, and `iterations`. The Runtime drives agent nodes through the public session contract (linked sessions, shared sandbox via `PutSession.sandbox`), offers `fn` / `verify` again on lease expiry, and routes executor Actions by `(workflowId, key)` with claim-scoped `ctx.sandbox`. Optional `message.manifest` is a turn-only variant of the session pin (turn manifests). Studio shows the manifest tree, live node status, and session links. Examples under `examples/agents/{chain,switch,parallel,map,loop,ship-feature}/`.

## 0.18.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 1cd7dc7: Add subagents: put an agent in another agent's `tools` (`Agent({ tools: [lookupOrder, researcher] })` or `.use({ tools: [researcher] })`) and the model can delegate to it. The tool is named after the agent's id, takes `{ task: string }`, and its description is the agent's `description`, which is now required for an agent used as a tool. The engine runs the child inside the parent's turn as a durable branch: fresh context, its own tools and hooks served by the root agent's executor, its own MCP servers, the session's sandbox, and only its final output (or `outputSchema` result) returned. Empty output, failures (with partial output marked as evidence), and requests for input or approval inside a child reach the parent as failed tool results. Parallel delegation calls run concurrently, completed child work is never re-run on replay, and cancelling the session cancels every child.

  v1 is one level deep and non-interactive. Nested delegation, child tools that declare `approval`, and differing sandboxes across the tree fail the build with a named diagnostic. The manifest adds an optional `agent` body on a tool (schema version unchanged), actions and effects carry `agent: { id, path, delegationId }`, tool context gains `ctx.agent`, the durable host resolves a new `delegation` effect kind, and the Runtime emits `delegation.started` / `delegation.completed` events and filters history with `?agent=` (`session.history({ agent })`). Studio shows delegations, labels child actions with their agent, and filters events by agent.

  - @nylorun/core@0.4.0-beta

## 0.17.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- b8d822a: Breaking beta: replace `beforeModelCall` / `afterModelCall` with scoped hooks. Register `before("turn" | "step", fn)` and `after("step" | "turn", fn)` on the agent, or `before: { turn, step }` / `after: { step, turn }` on a capability. `before("turn")` runs once per turn and its `Patch` applies to every model call in the turn; the new `after("turn")` returns a `TurnDecision` for the final answer. `after` hooks take one argument and receive `attempt`, and `retry` now retries instead of failing the run. The manifest moves to `manifestSchemaVersion: 4` with `capabilities[].hooks`, and `BeforeModelCallFn`, `AfterModelCallFn` and the `beforeModelCall` / `afterModelCall` action kinds are removed. Every capability registered at a hook point now runs in one `hook` executor action, an expired hook claim is offered again instead of becoming uncertain, and the durable engine version is `hosted-2`. Hook toggles now hide a capability's tools, or one tool of a multi-tool capability, instead of having no effect or failing. Studio lists each capability's hooks with how often they run and labels hook actions. See MIGRATION.md.

### Patch Changes

- b8d822a: Studio Model Settings lists multiple vault-stored providers, adds credentials through a sheet, and switches the active provider/model via Runtime host vault APIs.

### Minor Changes

- 3a88f51: Ship Agent-Plugins (`plugin()` / `loadPlugin`), Skills (`load_skill` / skill resources), Runtime MCP pool + vault credentials, and manifest v3 capability fields. Validate completed tool `output` against the tool output schema so ordinary tools with `outputSchema` no longer false-fail as `tool.invalid-output`.

## 0.15.0-beta

### Major Changes

- 2898d02: Extract shared definitions and contracts into core and local orchestration into
  CLI. Harness becomes execution-only; the SDK no longer installs the engine and
  Runtime no longer depends on the SDK. Author applications through agents and
  install cli for the unchanged nylorun commands. See the package architecture and
  migration guide. Cloud installs published packages from npm independently.

### Minor Changes

- 41e613c: Ship the local SDK registry workflow with an independent SQLite Runtime, connected tool executor, authenticated Studio proxy, and a text-and-tool starter. Replace the legacy Hono starter and AG-UI transport. Require Node 24 and include the SDK in exact release compatibility pins.

  Break the Harness execution import from `/engine` to `/run` and rename hosted execution APIs to durable execution APIs, including RunBinding, BoundRunOptions, and createRunState. Update all consumers without compatibility aliases; retain persisted checkpoint fields and version pins.

### Patch Changes

- Pin core to the tested release.
- Updated dependencies [2898d02]
  - @nylorun/core@0.1.1-beta

## Unreleased

### Minor Changes

- Breaking beta: replace `/engine` with `/run`; rename hosted execution to durable execution.
  Use `runDurable`, `createDurableCheckpoint`, `DurableCheckpoint`, `DurableResult`,
  `DurableHost`, `RunBinding`, `BoundRunOptions`, and `createRunState`. No aliases remain.
  Persisted checkpoint fields and the `hosted-1` compatibility pin are unchanged.

- Breaking beta: the package root is now an alias of `/define`. Import
  `createExecutionState` / `validateExecutionState` from `@nylorun/harness/run` and
  `preparedModel` from `@nylorun/harness/model/adapters`. Authoring and wire-contract specifiers remain unchanged.
- Internal source folder `execution/` is now `loop/` (one `run()` invocation). The
  `/model/adapters` specifier is unchanged.
- DX v5.6: Agent usable without `.build()`; `.use()` returns a new agent; top-level `tools` /
  `instructions` (no `model` on `Agent({})`). `tool()` accepts `input` / `output` / `run`; plain
  returns complete; export `ToolError`; tool `approval` / `effects`; `ctx.idempotencyKey`,
  `redelivery`, `state`, `session`, `progress`, and durable waits (`ask` / `approve` / `sleep` /
  `waitFor` / `step`).
- Agent-as-JSON: versioned manifest (`schemaVersion: 2`), `toJSON` / `Agent.from`, `hashManifest`,
  `checkCompatibility`; identity by manifest hash (not WeakMap-only). Session memory on
  `ExecutionState.state`. Capability `model` is no longer projected into the published manifest.
- Dynamics: `beforeModelCall` / `afterModelCall` with `Patch` / `Decision`; middleware deprecated
  but kept through 1.0. Export `@nylorun/harness/run` for run-from-checkpoint; `agent.run` is a
  1.0 alias. Export type-only `Session` / `Turn` / `Event` / `Result`.

## 0.13.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- Breaking beta: replace `AgentManifest.middleware` with a capability catalog. The published
  snapshot is `id`, `name`, optional `outputSchema`, and `capabilities` (`kind`,
  `hasMiddleware`, declared instructions / tool JSON schemas / model controls). Join traces by
  capability id. `MiddlewareManifest` is removed; import `CapabilityManifest`.
- Breaking beta: expose `BuiltAgent` as a type-only facade from `Agent(...).use(...).build()`.
  Hide compiled middleware, tool registries, and output validators. `AgentBuilder` accepts public
  agent options. `createExecutionState` requires the original built agent. Drop agent-level
  `executionVersion`; `ExecutionState.version` stays `1` and leftover keys are ignored. Model
  adapters receive immutable `ToolDescriptor` metadata only. Remove `defineToolFamily` /
  `ToolFamily` / `capability.toolFamilies` and the internal Bound\* / `SealedToolCall` root
  exports. Rename the per-run bag from `scope` to `info`.
- c5bbb1a: Breaking beta: make Harness `run()` a direct async state-in/state-out executor with
  serializable pauses, application `info`, cancellation signals, awaited recording, and
  agent-level output schemas. Runtime owns session scheduling with memory-default or exclusive
  local storage and imports Harness contracts. Isolate Node adapters under `runtime/node`, stream
  observations incrementally, and add opt-in bounded token previews with Studio reconciliation.
  Migrate consumers and deployment guidance together; legacy event records remain archived, not
  automatically replayed.

## 0.12.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 4badb5b: Move model execution to session startup, provide Runtime as a mountable Hono router, and generate Hono-first projects with supervised application and Studio development. Studio now resolves root-relative Runtime endpoints correctly for custom mount paths.

## 0.11.1-beta

### Patch Changes

- d27242c: Preserve opaque provider continuation metadata through assistant conversation history. Gemini tool calls now retain thought signatures when sending tool results back to the model, including signed empty text and reasoning blocks. Only the originating provider and model receive their signatures.

## 0.11.0-beta

### Minor Changes

- 54ab304: Support portable Runtime protocol version 2 while retaining legacy Studio
  manifest support. Move the Studio CLI into Runtime: use `nylorun studio
--agent-url <url>` instead of `nylo studio`. Applications should install Runtime
  directly and keep Studio as a development dependency.

  Retain session lists and media across development reloads, and recognize agent
  file changes on Windows. Validate noninteractive creator startup during release
  verification with deferred provider configuration.

  Include Harness in this release so the creator does not rely on an unpublished
  compatibility pin. Ship and verify all four packages together.

All notable changes to `@nylorun/harness` are documented in this file.

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Before 1.0, the public API is experimental: breaking changes may occur in minor releases, while patch releases are reserved for compatible fixes.

## Unreleased

## [0.10.0-beta.1] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Portable ordered media input parts with opaque JSON references preserved through sessions,
  transcripts, middleware, model calls, and observations.
- `preparedModel()` for adapters that need to materialize a provider request while exposing the
  JSON-safe derived call through the new `model.prepared` observation.
- Direct `inputSchema` and optional `outputSchema` tool contracts. Harness accepts Zod v4,
  synchronous Standard Schema values with JSON Schema conversion, and explicit validator-backed
  `defineSchema()` contracts.
- Structured input and output validation diagnostics on failed tool results.
- Per-turn `session.input({ ... }, { outputSchema })` contracts for locally validated terminal JSON
  results, including canonical model-call projection, JSON candidates, immutable final persistence,
  and `output.invalid` tripwires.

### Changed

- Bundled provider translators map direct URL image references and fail unsupported media with the
  stable `model.unsupported-content` error rather than dropping or stringifying it.
- Chat Completions and Responses translators project terminal output schemas without choosing
  provider strictness; Anthropic Messages reports `model.unsupported-output-schema` until an
  application supplies a custom prepared adapter.
- Tool definitions use `inputSchema` instead of `parameters`. Completed output is validated when an
  `outputSchema` is supplied; the resulting JSON is the same value recorded, observed, and sent to
  the model. Model configuration and `model.requested` observations expose optional output schemas.

### Breaking changes

- Replace every tool `parameters` field with `inputSchema`. `outputSchema` is now an optional tool
  contract and completed tool output may be any JSON value, not only a string.
- Terminal results, final events, and stream projections may now be JSON values. Consumers that
  assumed string output must render or serialize `JsonValue` safely.
- Custom model adapters receive the `reportPreparedCall` context method. Adapters that materialize
  provider requests should use it (or `preparedModel()`) to emit one JSON-safe derived request.

## [0.9.0-beta.1] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Public provider translator helpers under `@nylorun/harness/model/adapters` for OpenAI-compatible
  Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, and Anthropic Messages model loops.
- `MiddlewareManifest` and declared middleware contributions in `AgentManifest`, including static
  instructions, tool metadata, and model controls for host tooling such as Studio.

## [0.8.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-31

### Breaking changes

- `Agent()` now takes identity options instead of a model adapter. Migrate
  `Agent(adapter).use(...).build()` to
  `Agent({ id, name, instructions }).use(...).with(adapter).build()`.
- `.build()` exists only on `BoundAgentBuilder`, the type returned by a single `.with(onModelCall)`.
  `AgentBuilder` has `.use()` and `.with()` only.
- `AgentManifest` now includes `id` and `name`. Built agents expose the same fields as `agent.id`
  and `agent.name`.

### Added

- Optional constructor `instructions` compile as reserved `agent` middleware. A string is
  normalized to one instruction. Capability-specific instructions still go through `.use()`.

## [0.7.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-30

### Breaking changes

- Removed the bind-time directive argument: migrate `Agent(adapter, directive)` to
  `Agent(adapter).use({ id: "model", model: directive })`. `AgentManifest.model` is removed.
- Added `CapabilityDeclaration` support to `.use()`. A declaration owns one capability id, static
  tool/instruction/model contributions, and optional inline middleware.
- `ToolExecutionContext` now includes session, turn, step, and call identities.

### Added

- Declarations may own typed lazy session state through `CapabilityState`. State is shared only by
  that declaration's middleware and tools, is cold after seed recovery, and is disposed on
  `session.stop()` or recording failure.
- Added `capability.state.dispose.failed` observations for best-effort disposal failures.
- Added `capability.state.undeclared`, raised when session state is requested for a capability that
  declared none.

### Documentation

- Added concise package guidance for direct agent composition and the capability/service/host/core model.

## [0.6.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-29

### Breaking changes since 0.5.0-beta.1

- Removed tool adapters, `.with()`, `executeWith`, preflight, adapter concurrency controls, custom scheduling, adapter manifest fields, and adapter observations/errors.
- Tools now own their implementation through `execute(args, context)`. Harness centrally executes eligible siblings concurrently and commits normalized results in model-call order.
- Tool results are explicit `completed`, `denied`, and `failed` discriminated unions. Tool and model implementations may return `deferred` for a runtime handoff.

### Added

- Structural `SessionSeed` import through `agent.run({ seed })` and no-input `session.continue()`. Core validates typed JSON but deliberately leaves historical semantics and provider protocol validation to the host and model adapter.
- Optional awaited `SessionRecorder`, immutable full-state `SessionRecord` values, monotonic revisions, and effect barriers around input, model requests, candidates, tool results, waiting, final, and stop transitions.
- JSON-safe active model/tool/interaction records with stable invocation identities, tool ownership provenance, settled/deferred state, and opaque handoff tokens.
- `model.deferred`, `tool.started`, `tool.completed`, `tool.deferred`, `session.seeded`, `session.continued`, and `session.record.failed` observations.

### Reliability

- Recorder failure now fences later model/tool effects, quarantines late results, stops queued work, preserves the last successfully recorded revision, and exposes `session.record-failed` with the storage error as its cause.
- Deferred sibling batches settle fully without committing a partial model-facing `tool-results` entry.

## [0.5.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-28

### Breaking changes since 0.4.0-rc.1

- Replaced persistent `prefix` configuration with per-step `configuration`. Instructions, tools, model selection, and runtime context are assembled afresh for every model call; slot removal, context lifetimes, strict prefix policy, and Harness-owned drift auditing were removed. Middleware receives `turnId` and `stepId` to coordinate application-owned state.
- `model.prefix` and `model.started` were replaced by `model.requested`, emitted immediately before adapter invocation with the exact immutable `ModelCall` and JSON-safe attributed configuration/context snapshots.
- `tool()` now validates and normalizes its synchronous Zod object schema eagerly; raw tool literals retain first-bind preparation.

- Model adapters now receive the projected `ModelCall` as their first argument and `{ request, signal }` as their second. Implementations that consumed the prior request-shaped input must migrate to the projection and use `request` for the structured escape hatch.
- `InputHandle.consume()` and `AgentRunInput` were removed. Submit messages and interaction replies through the Session input API and await the returned completion handle instead.
- `session.observe()` now returns an idempotent unsubscribe function rather than the previous observer result. Observers remain live-only and do not replay history.
- Tool adapters and the tool facade removed the prior route-validation and route metadata methods. Tool definitions use `parameters` and `executeWith`; dispatch validation happens at the sealed Harness boundary.
- Harness-owned failures now use `HarnessError` with stable machine-readable codes. The prior outcome-code model has been replaced; see the migration table in the README for renamed and split codes. Foreign application, model, and adapter errors remain available as causes.

### Added

- `ModelCall` projection, including canonical system text, transcript messages, provider tool contracts, model directive, and session id.
- Explicit abort propagation through the Model adapter context.
- Stable structured Harness errors via `HarnessError`, `HarnessErrorCode`, and `isHarnessError`.
- Parallel sibling tool execution by default, with an optional shared per-adapter `maxConcurrentCalls` limit on `.with(adapter, options)`.

### Fixed

- Observe attributes are materialized only when a listener is registered. Transcript snapshots on `step.started` share the already-frozen step transcript rather than deep-copying it on every step.
